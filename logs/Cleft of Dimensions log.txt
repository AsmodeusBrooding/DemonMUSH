Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
A fighting palico has arrived from the south.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Qqq has summoned you!

Sunsnug Isle - The Mainland
  The main area of the sandy white island stretches around, here.  The main
focal point of this area is a large hut, made from skins, tusks, and other
animal parts, along with a large sign near the entrance.  Not directly
connected to the hut, a chimney pokes up out of the sand, smoke gently
billowing out.  Short bushy ferns and medium height tropical trees grow
around the hut, decorating the island.  The dock is accessible to the south,
east, and west, the dock to the southeast and southwest being too high up
with no way to climb or jump to it.

(] Exits: east south west [)
     A large blue hut made out of various animal parts is standing proudly here.
(Charmed) A valiant bipedal cat is standing audaciously here.
QqqQ Qqq (((Q(Q(Q_Q(Q_Q)Q_Q)Q)Q))) is here.
A siamese cat is here holding a broom.

animal parts, along with a large sign near the entrance.  Not directly
connected to the hut, a chimney pokes up out of the sand, smoke gently

Sunsnug Isle - The Mainland
  The main area of the sandy white island stretches around, here.  The main
focal point of this area is a large hut, made from skins, tusks, and other
animal parts, along with a large sign near the entrance.  Not directly
connected to the hut, a chimney pokes up out of the sand, smoke gently
billowing out.  Short bushy ferns and medium height tropical trees grow
around the hut, decorating the island.  The dock is accessible to the south,
east, and west, the dock to the southeast and southwest being too high up
with no way to climb or jump to it.

(] Exits: east south west [)
     A large blue hut made out of various animal parts is standing proudly here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.
A siamese cat is here holding a broom.

Sunsnug Isle - The Mainland
  The main area of the sandy white island stretches around, here.  The main
focal point of this area is a large hut, made from skins, tusks, and other
animal parts, along with a large sign near the entrance.  Not directly
connected to the hut, a chimney pokes up out of the sand, smoke gently
billowing out.  Short bushy ferns and medium height tropical trees grow
around the hut, decorating the island.  The dock is accessible to the south,
east, and west, the dock to the southeast and southwest being too high up
with no way to climb or jump to it.

(] Exits: east south west [)
     A large blue hut made out of various animal parts is standing proudly here.
A uniformed grey tabby wanders, here.
A cute cat is here standing on two legs.
A cute cat is here standing on two legs.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.
A siamese cat is here holding a broom.

Sunsnug Isle - The Mainland
  The main area of the sandy white island stretches around, here.  The main
focal point of this area is a large hut, made from skins, tusks, and other
animal parts, along with a large sign near the entrance.  Not directly
connected to the hut, a chimney pokes up out of the sand, smoke gently
billowing out.  Short bushy ferns and medium height tropical trees grow
around the hut, decorating the island.  The dock is accessible to the south,
east, and west, the dock to the southeast and southwest being too high up
with no way to climb or jump to it.

(] Exits: east south west [)
     A large blue hut made out of various animal parts is standing proudly here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.
A siamese cat is here holding a broom.

Sunsnug Isle - The Mainland
  The main area of the sandy white island stretches around, here.  The main
focal point of this area is a large hut, made from skins, tusks, and other
animal parts, along with a large sign near the entrance.  Not directly
connected to the hut, a chimney pokes up out of the sand, smoke gently
billowing out.  Short bushy ferns and medium height tropical trees grow
around the hut, decorating the island.  The dock is accessible to the south,
east, and west, the dock to the southeast and southwest being too high up
with no way to climb or jump to it.

(] Exits: east south west [)
     A large blue hut made out of various animal parts is standing proudly here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.
A siamese cat is here holding a broom.

Sunsnug Isle - The Mainland
  The main area of the sandy white island stretches around, here.  The main
focal point of this area is a large hut, made from skins, tusks, and other
animal parts, along with a large sign near the entrance.  Not directly
connected to the hut, a chimney pokes up out of the sand, smoke gently
billowing out.  Short bushy ferns and medium height tropical trees grow
around the hut, decorating the island.  The dock is accessible to the south,
east, and west, the dock to the southeast and southwest being too high up
with no way to climb or jump to it.

(] Exits: east south west [)
     A large blue hut made out of various animal parts is standing proudly here.
A cute cat is here standing on two legs.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.
A siamese cat is here holding a broom.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
A fighting palico appears in the room.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
An important-looking woman in a dark pink suit wanders the city, in good spirits.
A mustachioed musician cranks a music box here, monkey perched on his shoulder.
A fighting palico has arrived from the west.

Truce Canyon - Roadway
  A dirt road leading from Truce heads northward, sloping upwards, towards

made of packed earth, colored a light gray, which blends slowly into the
surrounding grass.  To the east, there is a tall hill, covered with weeds,
which stands by itself.  To the west, the land slowly becomes impassable and
overgrown with trees and brambles as it turns into forest.

has grown up, spreading all the way to the banks.  Across the canyon from
here, the river seems to start to curve towards the east.  The trail
continues to the north and south, with a cliff to the east dropping down
into the woods below.

  The trail splits here, one way heading northward down a shallow incline
towards the western canyon floor, and another way eastward across the canyon
via a naturally-formed stone bridge.  North of here, the river seems to be
faster and stronger, but with fewer trees, and less grass surrounding it. 
The long trail to the south winds a way back towards the city of Truce.

Truce Canyon - Canyon Floor
  On this side of the bridge, the canyon has much less vegetation, and the
stone shows its natural, reddish-brown color.  The canyon floor is littered
with gravel, sand, and bits of dried wood, as a result of the rare flooding
of the Lete.  The canyon wall opens up to the west, with the road running

Bustling Canyon, Cosmo - Entrance
  A large sign is affixed to the ground here, inviting all travellers into
the city to enjoy themselves.  The city is large and tiny huts dot the
canyon wall, with ladders dangling from their bottoms like hanging roots. 
Red stone surrounds you on all sides, casting the canyon into shade, which
is dispelled by a large fire to the east.

Metal slimes are a conundrum of sorts, as they are both metal and slimes. They are not molten metal, which would be reasonable to be slime-consistency, but rather simply both metal and slimes at once, defying all physics and expectations. They also tend to be flighty and scared to fight, choosing to run away instead, though they do rarely decide to fight back on a good day.

  A few glints and gleams seem to spring up from the trees that lay
increasingly closer to the northern valley.  The path continues down this
side of the mountain, growing considerably less rocky as it leads on.  The
few random trees that do stand from the road remain very still, despite the
slow increase in wind speeds.

  The vegetatious population continues to grow along the sides of the road,
continuing at a downhill slant towards the north.  A few flakes of snow
present themselves along the way, and the temperature plummets at a

  A quick drop along the path forces one to take caution on their descent,
at this point; the trail seems to have become slippery, almost all of a

the area that lay nearer to the north, still.  The shiny-white of shimmering
trees can be made out clearly, now, giving the impression of a frosty
wonderland in the midst.

  The path picks back up levelly, fortunately, making progress easier once

cold, however.  A faint chime sounds in the distance, very musical in tone,
fitting in very well with the surrounding wilderness.

  Finally, at the bottom of the hill looms a massive frozen woodland of

definitely coming from this area, continuing to play out a melody of

  The air around you is suddenly much more chilled as you enter this wintry
woodland.  Crystalline trees and structures stretch as far as the eye can
see, each one giving off a bright gleam as the winter sun reflects off of
every visible leaf and surface.  Snowflakes swirl lightly around, giving the
whole scene a shimmering coat of sparkling white paint, seemingly.  The path
southwest leads back to the mountains, while a nigh-invisible trail leads on
in a northern direction.

the trees nearby, as if they were expressing their happiness at existing in
such an overall peaceful region, despite the frigid conditions.

  Despite the quick bend in the path, the trail still continues to the

A silent wind blows past quickly, to the west, sending the immediate snow-
fall shooting with it.  These conditions couldn't possibly be bearable to
many creatures, much less plant life, but these crystal trees seem to have
been created directly from the area, healthy and full of life.  Several
howls emerge from the north, as well as the eastern direction.

  Footsteps in the snow would suggest that lupine beings have traversed

also hard to tell if they could still be around.  The path forks, leading
back to the south, and onward to the east and west, as the snow continues to

louder and more fervent as one presses forward into this shimmering realm.

ones to the north, a log cabin constructed from toppled forest trees.  A

  The path ends here where the forest borders along the east and south as
well.  The forest shelters houses from the tough mountain winds.  A stream
flows from the west into a small town resevoir here, free for drinking.  The
resevoir is protected on most sides by a stone guard rail, and a pump stands
on one end which is used rather than gathering it by hand.  A larger cabin
house stands to the north with its welcoming doors open, a wreath hanging
from a wooden nail driven into the center.

Guardia - Todo
  The path into this small village continues toward the east where more
cabins lie, and to the northwest toward the entrance to town and the frosty
forest.  Some creaky wooden steps lead up to the patio of a large cabin
house to the west of here.  Lined along the south edge of the pathway here
are rows and rows of chopped up lumber, an important resource to the town. 
A stream flowing from the south through the forest trees splits two ways to
the north and to the east, small stone bridges leading over each.

Guardia - Todo Docks
  The snow that has fallen here is much thicker and colder than the rest
of the Frosty Forest.  In fact, the sloping path is so cold that footing is
frighteningly unsure.  The northeast end seems to slope more sharply down,
dropping into a sunken pass in the snow.  A large wide clear river flows
from the southeast to the northwest - a small town can be seen far west on
the other side.  There is a tiny wooden dock here.

  The snowy path here declines sharply to the northeast.  The sound of

  The air here is bone-chillingly cold. Each breath would form an impressive cloud of steam if it weren't snowing profusely. The cold, wet flakes swirl about in an angry dance.

  A thickly snow-clouded forest of trees sprouts up just beyond the break through the pass, here, almost as if by magic.

  The snow-laden grove seems to almost shift and spread intentionally in effort to obscure its secrets from the world - the harsh, frigid winds swirling large amounts of falling snow all around, no spot safe from the piercing cold.

  The trees begin to give way further ahead, their encroachment toward the west waning, though unfortunately their limelight is stolen by a creeping mountain range intent on creating an incredibly hazardous journey. The area is still enveloped in snow, cloaking the true nature of anything one might stumble upon. There is one decidedly small break through the uneven terrain, towards the northeast, while a hole that appears to have been created with dynamite is to the southeast.

Guardia - Jagged Forest
  A somewhat evident path through the trees, wrapping around from the north toward the east, is a reassuring view in this blizzard entrenched thicket. Huge drifts cover almost entire trees in piles of snow, the winds playing as they please with the unceasing tempest of wintery white.

Guardia - Jagged Forest
  The snow-laden grove seems to almost shift and spread intentionally in effort to obscure its secrets from the world - the harsh, frigid winds swirling large amounts of falling snow all around, no spot safe from the piercing cold. If it were not for a clearly obvious mountain bursting up from the ground toward the east, there would be no distinguishable landmarks in this forest.

Guardia - Jagged Forest
  A thickly snow-clouded forest of trees sprouts up just beyond the break through the pass, here, almost as if by magic. The terrain is treacherous, though the woods are somewhat sparse here, allowing exploration further into the thicket in several directions. It's nearly impossible to tell what may await through the trees.

Guardia - Jagged Pass
  The air here is bone-chillingly cold. Each breath would form an impressive cloud of steam if it weren't snowing profusely. The cold, wet flakes swirl about in an angry dance. The path continues deeper into the snow, however it is also veiled by the thick snow storm hanging over it, barely concealing a breach through the eastside of the pass.

Madra Ice Field - Snowy Embankment
  A trail winds back and forth through the snow, leading to an old stone
building at the top of the embankment.  It looks to have been a gatehouse of
some kind as the remains of ancient stone walls have crumbled next to it. 
The faded crest of a gothic 'B' over a hammer and a sword can be faintly
made out over the entrance to the gatehouse.  The snow forms another, more
narrow path down the slope to the southwest.

Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch
  Snow has fallen in two large banks here, forming a frozen ditch to pass
through.  From here you can see across the rest of the ice field.  It looks
to be nothing but a vast plain of snow encircled by an ancient and destroyed
stone wall.  The field is so deeply frozen that a wall is quite redundant
protection for the area.  To the northwest is a deep crack in the snowy
earth.

Madra Ice Field - Slippery Crossing
  At this point in the ditch, a tree has rolled down the embankment and
ripped open a vast patch of frozen mud.  Even worse, the snow has since
renewed itself, and the mud is now not only frozen but slushy as well. 
Animal tracks dot the mud and the nearby snow, and may warrant a closer
look.

  The ditch takes a sharp curve here.  To the west is the icy mud patch,

that it is not possible to look out across the field any longer.  It seems
the snow has begun to freeze from the bottom, threatening to harden it into
walls.

  Crossing this frozen stream will prove to be very tricky indeed.

ice.  The frozen stream continues to the east.

Madra Ice Field - Wall of Ice
  The path comes to an end here at a wall of shimmering ice.  It is so
smooth and crystalline that it reflects everything here clearly.  Two arches
of white marble are built into the wall, into which has been placed a
reinforced metal door.  Strangely, the doors show no wear from the frost and
age.  Glowing silver runes are written across the wall, inviting a closer
look.

Guardia - Todo Docks
  The snow that has fallen here is much thicker and colder than the rest
of the Frosty Forest.  In fact, the sloping path is so cold that footing is
frighteningly unsure.  The northeast end seems to slope more sharply down,
dropping into a sunken pass in the snow.  A large wide clear river flows
from the southeast to the northwest - a small town can be seen far west on
the other side.  There is a tiny wooden dock here.

Guardia - Outskirts of Todo
  The snowy path here declines sharply to the northeast.  The sound of
wind and bad weather is echoing nearby, but the unilluminated entrance to
the cavern gapes silently.  To the southwest, the path begins to rise up
toward a small shack by a river.

  The air here is bone-chillingly cold. Each breath would form an impressive cloud of steam if it weren't snowing profusely. The cold, wet flakes swirl about in an angry dance. The path continues deeper into the snow, however it is also veiled by the thick snow storm hanging over it, barely concealing a breach through the eastside of the pass.

  A thickly snow-clouded forest of trees sprouts up just beyond the break through the pass, here, almost as if by magic. The terrain is treacherous, though the woods are somewhat sparse here, allowing exploration further into the thicket in several directions. It's nearly impossible to tell what may await through the trees.

  The snow-laden grove seems to almost shift and spread intentionally in effort to obscure its secrets from the world - the harsh, frigid winds swirling large amounts of falling snow all around, no spot safe from the piercing cold. If it were not for a clearly obvious mountain bursting up from the ground toward the east, there would be no distinguishable landmarks in this forest.

Guardia - Jagged Forest
  The trees begin to give way further ahead, their encroachment toward the west waning, though unfortunately their limelight is stolen by a creeping mountain range intent on creating an incredibly hazardous journey. The area is still enveloped in snow, cloaking the true nature of anything one might stumble upon. There is one decidedly small break through the uneven terrain, towards the northeast, while a hole that appears to have been created with dynamite is to the southeast.

Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle
  Here, beneath the magically-projected night sky, several twisted trees
reach for the moon with their leafless branches.  Upon closer inspection,
they are cleverly-carved pillars, and help to support the ceiling under the
weight of the earth and snow above.  Careful, even stone placement makes the
south and northeast paths flow together in a gentle curve around the corner.
A heavy, inconspicious wooden door has been placed in the northwestern wall.

Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle
  Lit with bat-shaped torches that flutter through the darkness, this
cobblestone pathway opens widely to the east as it approaches a busy street.
A heavy wooden door has been set in the western wall, well-cared for over
the years.  A wide window peers northern across what should be a blank stone
wall, but is instead the magically enchanted view of a forest in the night. 
A skeleton painted on the wall has been magically animated, and dances
around, clattering its bones together.

Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle
  Forming the top of a perfectly round hallway with the rest of the
Voodoo Circle continuing east and west, this hallway is especially wide. 
The dull brown cobblestones paving the street transition into shining stones
of deep onyx on the northern street.  A magical breeze blows through one of
the windows in the wall, completely artificial and not chilling at all. 
Because the dark castle is so far below the ground, all the windows have
been sealed with stone and enchanted like the ceiling to peer out into the
night sky.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Paved with deep ebony stones that reflect the starlight above, this
street glimmers sinisterly.  The corners of the walls are studded with stone
gargoyle heads and carved faces of humans in pain.  The statue of a
beautiful woman, wrapped in bat-like wings, levitates unassisted above and
lights the room with the fire eternally burning in its mouth.  To the south,
the street is cobbled with dull brown stones rather than the jet black
stones here.  To the east and west, the onyx pathway is paved.  To the
north, set of french doors is half-hanging open.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Spidering off at sharp angles, the onyx-studded street forms a junction
here.  To the west is a blazing statue hovering at the ceiling.  The heavy
door to the southeast is closed, and murky black mist seems to radiate
through the cracks.  Passing under the malevolent gaze of a row of stone
vampire statues, the widest path continues to the northeast.  A single black
crow can be seen through the dark castle windows, ever-circling the full
moon.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Masterfully sculpted from the heavy stone of the castle, several
inanimate hands are reaching out from the walls on either side of this eerie
hall.  Next to the southwestern bend, several statues are being held by the
carved stone hands.  They are undead masters of the night, and cast their
terrifying vampiric gaze upon anyone who traverses the glittering onyx-paved
street.  A break in the eastern wall has been fitted with a shoddy,
ill-fitting doorframe with a sloppily scribbled shop sign hung on the door. 
The path leading around the northwest corner descends into an inky murk of
damp and heavy fog.

Brigantes Castle - Pip's Pawn Shop
  This shop is so full of random objects and incoherent displays that it
is entirely claustrophobic to anyone inside.  Old swords, single gloves, and
other mismatched equipment lie scattered around.  The largest shelf holds
many empty bottles, a pocketwatch, a stuffed Rabite and several waterlogged
books.  Amid the hodgepodge of possessions, one table has been kept clear
and a chair put behind it.  A very bright lamp, shaped like a severed leg
and resting on the back table, is the only source of harsh illumination.

Brigantes Castle - Pip's Pawn Shop
  This shop is so full of random objects and incoherent displays that it
is entirely claustrophobic to anyone inside.  Old swords, single gloves, and
other mismatched equipment lie scattered around.  The largest shelf holds
many empty bottles, a pocketwatch, a stuffed Rabite and several waterlogged
books.  Amid the hodgepodge of possessions, one table has been kept clear
and a chair put behind it.  A very bright lamp, shaped like a severed leg
and resting on the back table, is the only source of harsh illumination.

Brigantes Castle - Pip's Pawn Shop
  This shop is so full of random objects and incoherent displays that it
is entirely claustrophobic to anyone inside.  Old swords, single gloves, and
other mismatched equipment lie scattered around.  The largest shelf holds
many empty bottles, a pocketwatch, a stuffed Rabite and several waterlogged
books.  Amid the hodgepodge of possessions, one table has been kept clear
and a chair put behind it.  A very bright lamp, shaped like a severed leg
and resting on the back table, is the only source of harsh illumination.

This scrappy little cat is a fighting palico, specialized in attacking enemies and sometimes a bit too eagerly. These types of palicos are known for getting themselves into trouble!

Brigantes Castle - Pip's Pawn Shop
  This shop is so full of random objects and incoherent displays that it
is entirely claustrophobic to anyone inside.  Old swords, single gloves, and
other mismatched equipment lie scattered around.  The largest shelf holds
many empty bottles, a pocketwatch, a stuffed Rabite and several waterlogged
books.  Amid the hodgepodge of possessions, one table has been kept clear
and a chair put behind it.  A very bright lamp, shaped like a severed leg

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Masterfully sculpted from the heavy stone of the castle, several
inanimate hands are reaching out from the walls on either side of this eerie
hall.  Next to the southwestern bend, several statues are being held by the
carved stone hands.  They are undead masters of the night, and cast their
terrifying vampiric gaze upon anyone who traverses the glittering onyx-paved
street.  A break in the eastern wall has been fitted with a shoddy,
ill-fitting doorframe with a sloppily scribbled shop sign hung on the door. 
The path leading around the northwest corner descends into an inky murk of
damp and heavy fog.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Spidering off at sharp angles, the onyx-studded street forms a junction
here.  To the west is a blazing statue hovering at the ceiling.  The heavy
door to the southeast is closed, and murky black mist seems to radiate
through the cracks.  Passing under the malevolent gaze of a row of stone
vampire statues, the widest path continues to the northeast.  A single black
crow can be seen through the dark castle windows, ever-circling the full
moon.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Paved with deep ebony stones that reflect the starlight above, this
street glimmers sinisterly.  The corners of the walls are studded with stone
gargoyle heads and carved faces of humans in pain.  The statue of a
beautiful woman, wrapped in bat-like wings, levitates unassisted above and
lights the room with the fire eternally burning in its mouth.  To the south,
the street is cobbled with dull brown stones rather than the jet black
stones here.  To the east and west, the onyx pathway is paved.  To the
north, set of french doors is half-hanging open.

  Chains are screwed into the walls here, restraining what would appear
to be hands reaching out of the walls.  In the palm of each hand is a small
purple flame, lighting this corridor with an eerie glow.  The onyx-studded
road subtly sparkles with muted tones of the fuschia fire.  To the east, a
floating statue illuminates the promenade.  To the northwest, the eerie path
comes to a sharp, angular junction.

  Grotesque stone carvings jut from the castle walls, terrifying

off at a sharp angle to the south, bypassing a door covered with cobwebs and
labeled BANK in several languages.  To the northeast and southeast,
Nightmare Promenade continues its circular flow.  To the north, a beastly
claw is lazily drifting about, clutching a Sorcery Street sign.  The sounds
of neighing and stamping seem to come from the west.

Brigantes Castle - Beastly Bank
  The most prominent architecture in the room are the metal bars behind
which the banker is protected.  They are formed like a spiderweb in front of
the counter through which citizens pass their money for safe deposit.  Real
spiders of the non-metal variety seem to have taken a liking to the
protective bars as well, spinning their own long-forgotten cobwebs among the
false gossamer.  The marble counter and floor are chipped and cracked, but
the massive stone vault in the back wall seems to be in perfect condition. 
A door with a bell attached to it leads back out onto the northern Nightmare
Promenade.

  The sounds of hammer clanging against anvil ring out from the hulking

heavily laden with coal and ore indicates that frequent shipments are the
cause.

  Slimy, damp fog haunts this corridor and swirls eerily against the
artificial night sky.  Smooth, polished stones comprise the onyx pathway
which is cobbled along the southeast and western halls.  The shop doorway to
the northeast is fit with a door but is always hanging open, piercing the
murk with light from an unknown origin within the shop.  Oddly enough, an
unseen force seems to discourage the mist from coiling its way into the
interior.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Slimy, damp fog haunts this corridor and swirls eerily against the
artificial night sky.  Smooth, polished stones comprise the onyx pathway
which is cobbled along the southeast and western halls.  The shop doorway to
the northeast is fit with a door but is always hanging open, piercing the
murk with light from an unknown origin within the shop.  Oddly enough, an
unseen force seems to discourage the mist from coiling its way into the
interior.

  The source of the thick coils of fog that encircle the southwest and

leads into a shop from which the cloud is billowing.  The lights inside
spark and flicker, spilling color into the dark street.  The promenade
continues along the east and southwestern roads, its river of onyx-cobbled
streets flowing circularly.

  The sounds of hammer clanging against anvil ring out from the hulking

occasionally drifts out of the door and into the dark streets.  Here the
cobblestones are marked with deep gouges, and the presence of a metal cart
heavily laden with coal and ore indicates that frequent shipments are the
cause.

  Grotesque stone carvings jut from the castle walls, terrifying

road, only a single torch-holding hand lights the passage.  A passage shoots
off at a sharp angle to the south, bypassing a door covered with cobwebs and
labeled BANK in several languages.  To the northeast and southeast,
Nightmare Promenade continues its circular flow.  To the north, a beastly
claw is lazily drifting about, clutching a Sorcery Street sign.  The sounds
of neighing and stamping seem to come from the west.

Brigantes Castle - Beastly Bank
  The most prominent architecture in the room are the metal bars behind
which the banker is protected.  They are formed like a spiderweb in front of
the counter through which citizens pass their money for safe deposit.  Real
spiders of the non-metal variety seem to have taken a liking to the
protective bars as well, spinning their own long-forgotten cobwebs among the
false gossamer.  The marble counter and floor are chipped and cracked, but
the massive stone vault in the back wall seems to be in perfect condition. 
A door with a bell attached to it leads back out onto the northern Nightmare
Promenade.

  Gorgeous lavender curtains are hung in velvelt folds across all the

Brigantes Castle - Enchanted Evenings
  Gorgeous lavender curtains are hung in velvelt folds across all the
windows in this quaint shop.  The floor is of black and pink stone tiles,
and polished to a faint lustre.  Everything is perfectly organized on
shelves around the room - jars of ingredients, spell components, strange
boxes, and other magical bric-a-brac.  The room is lit by a single, pink
crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling above.  A wide circle, adorned
with astrological signs and runes, has been inked onto the floor around the
shopkeeper's chair.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

time.  A narrow bridge to the northwest leads towards a small village.

  Made from planks of wood, a sturdy bridge spans the stream between Crysta

deeper here, as opposed to further north.  The bridge is wide enough for a
cart to pass over, and sturdy enough to hold it.  Shallow ruts in the wood

  A majestic arch, carved from a massive block of buff sandstone and

it runs a wide dirt road, lightly furrowed by the passing of carts, pulled
by draft animals and loaded with produce.  The road blends softly into the
grass alongside it, having no easily definable boundary, as it leads

Ark has thrust at you! (26)
You evade Ark's bash, causing him to fall flat on his face.
Ark runs up to you with his weapon poised to attack, and with dextrous movements slashes at you repeatedly.
Slashing at you with a precise aim, Ark brings down his weapon vertically upon you - slicing your torso.
Twisting his body gracefully, Ark brings the other end of his weapon up and slams it against your face.
Recovering from his manuever Ark lunges forward with the tip of his weapon - piercing your torso.
Following up on his attack Ark jumps off the floor and flips back - assaulting your face with a flip kick.
Ark is at the brink of death.

You receive 0 experience points.
Ark groans loudly as he takes a few steps away from you.
Ark says 'Okay, okay.  You're good, I'll give you that.'
Ark grins weakly, yet still retaining a rather smug expression on his face.
Ark says 'You're a true hero, you know? Since it does take one to beat one.'
Ark reaches down and begins to untie that straps the bind his armor to his torso.
Ark says 'Here take it, you deserve it.'
You get the HeroArmor.
Ark says 'Oh yeah, this take also.  If you can use it, it'll be a great addition to your weaponry.'
You get the HeroPike.
Ark winces softly as he brings a hand to his ribs - gingerly touching them.
Ark says 'Ugh, I need a rest.  See ya around, eh? '
Ark snaps his fingers as a hole in the ceiling begins to open.
A current of wind rises up from the ground, as it pushes up towards the hole in the ceiling.

Crysta - Ark's Room
  A simple room with little decoration, this room is meant mainly as a
place to rest.  The bed consists of a large, fluffy, pillow-like mattress
against the middle of the western wall, with a window just above it.  A pair
of chests, containing mundane items like clothes and blankets, sit against
the southern wall, while an armor rack is by the door, currently empty.  The
door to the east leads back to the main hall.

With a thud, you land on your feet and find yourself back in Ark's bedroom.
Ark says 'Alright, alright.  Everyone out, I need some sleep to heal up.'
Ark pushes about anyone present, forcing them to retreat towards the east.

Crysta - Elder's
  With a wooden floor and plaster walls, this room serves as the main hall
of the elder's mansion.  While the whole building is much smaller than
mansions in other cities, it is definitely the largest residental structure
in Crysta.  A long, polished table, surrounded with chairs, dominates most
of the room, with a stone fireplace on the southern wall, behind a chair at
the head of the table, which besides its location is the same as the rest. 
A blue wooden door is set into the western wall, while the northern wall has
a double-width empty doorway, leading into the kitchen.  The front door is
to the east.

     A large wooden bookcase is up against the wall.

Crysta - Elder's
  With a wooden floor and plaster walls, this room serves as the main hall
of the elder's mansion.  While the whole building is much smaller than
mansions in other cities, it is definitely the largest residental structure
in Crysta.  A long, polished table, surrounded with chairs, dominates most
of the room, with a stone fireplace on the southern wall, behind a chair at
the head of the table, which besides its location is the same as the rest. 
A blue wooden door is set into the western wall, while the northern wall has
a double-width empty doorway, leading into the kitchen.  The front door is
to the east.

Crysta - Roadway
  North of the center of Crysta, a heavily-used road stretches towards a
windmill up ahead and to the west side of the road.  To the immediate west,
a large, one-storied building with lots of windows , designated as the
elder's mansion, spreads over a plot of land.  Between the windmill and the
mansion, a strip of grass with a large oak tree provides shade to the
northern side of the building.  The door, to the west, has been propped open
with a broom.  Along the eastern side of the road, between it and the
stream, there is a wide strip of grassy lawn.

road is in better condition, as it recieves much less traffic.  On all
corners besides the northeast, a structure of some sort stands.  A simple

Placid Village, Crysta - The Gate
  A majestic arch, carved from a massive block of buff sandstone and
sparsely covered with climbing ivy, stands as the gate into Crysta.  Through
it runs a wide dirt road, lightly furrowed by the passing of carts, pulled
by draft animals and loaded with produce.  The road blends softly into the
grass alongside it, having no easily definable boundary, as it leads
westward into the village.  A bridge to the east heads back to the fields.

Guardia Fields - A Bridge
  Made from planks of wood, a sturdy bridge spans the stream between Crysta
and the fields.  Flowing from the mountains to the south, the stream is
deeper here, as opposed to further north.  The bridge is wide enough for a
cart to pass over, and sturdy enough to hold it.  Shallow ruts in the wood
lead eastward to the fields, and west into the village of Crysta.  The
stream flows here from a mountain range that borders these fertile lands.

  The far south-by-southwestern reaches of these open plains reaches an
abrupt end just short of a steadily-flowing creek, still moving northward at
a relatively-quickening rate.  A few taller fields are in growth, here, as
it does make sense that one would grow their crops as close to the water as
possible; one never knows when rain will or will not fall, for any amount of
time.  A narrow bridge to the northwest leads towards a small village.

Walking to: Free City, Truce - Fountain

Peaceful Fields of Guardia
  The rich fields of the westlands continue on a little ways to the west,
and still farther towards the south.  A stream flows alongside the north,
blocked off by a fence.  A gentle breeze blows through the luxuriant
meadowlands, causing a rustling wave to spread across the grass.  A few
passing birds sing merrily overhead.  Also, the main road can be accessed to
the east.

Guardia - A Dirt Road
  A dirt path leads out of Truce, leading south towards the edge of a
mountain range.  Wooden fences line the sides of the path, and tall, lush
grass grows just beyond them.  A small stone bridge extends just beyond the
gate of Truce, leading over a rushing creek that flows from the western
fields toward the eastern shore.

Truce - Southern Gate
  The well-kept road transforms into loose gravel and then into a dirt path
as it leads past the iron gates marking the southern extreme of Truce.  A
side path branches from it, trekking west along the city limits.  A large
sign hangs overhead, with 'TRUCE' written in fancy bold letters.  A guard
station stands to the east.

Truce - Boulevard
  This broad boulevard connects the southern reaches of the city.  Standing
in the center of the street is a statue of a deranged-looking, smiling man. 
The pungent aroma of incense wafts from the westward tent, competing
with the scent of alcohol coming from the eastward inn.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.
