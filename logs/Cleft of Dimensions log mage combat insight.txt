A beautiful and charismatic red-skinned humanoid with horns and glowing
red eyes towers over you at a staggering 13 feet tall.  His beard is
perfectly trimmed, and his smile is overwhelming with confidence.  He is
adorned with expensive black and red clothes, of which are said to be
valuable enough to cover the annual spending of any nation.  In one hand you
see a Ruby Rod of Asmodeus, proof that this is one of the avatars of
Asmodeus.  Underneath the expensive garments, his body is wracked with
bleeding injuries, but he seems completely unconcerned with the pain the
injuries have caused him.

Canyon, before turning east, then and running alongside it.  The road to the

  As the trail runs along the side of the canyon, it gives a wonderful view

has grown up, spreading all the way to the banks.  Across the canyon from
here, the river seems to start to curve towards the east.  The trail

Truce Canyon - West Bank
  The western side of this large stone bridge is much like the surrounding
area, in that it has some thin grass, a few shrubs, and a dirt road running
down the middle.  What is unusual about it is the fact that is is a single,
solid piece of rock, formed from whatever the river carved through to make
the canyon.  The road here runs east and west.

  A small, shady stand of large hardwood trees exists just off the main

reason, the trees surrounding this grove haven't grown nearly as tall, but
seem to be normal, healthy trees anyway.  The ground is covered with soft
dead leaves of various kinds, most of the undergrowth having been bullied

feet wide and has a four foot tall metal guard rail running along it's
sides.  A massive metal arch hangs over the entrance stating the name of the

their merchandise around the wooden planks.  Many tents have been pitched
along the sides of the walkway, with various traveling merchants displaying
items ranging from decorated eggs to posters with inspirational messages on
them.  Lightposts stand in the center of the area at each fifty foot

are to the south, taking up most of the length of the boardwalk.  To the

in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,

in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,

   This is a small tent just north of the central staging area of the

one to the northwest and a blue one to the northeast.  A large

  Spread out over a way-too-large-to-be-inside-a-tent room, a little over
half a dozen different machines are lined up in compartmentalized rooms,
each one serving a different purpose.  Hanging signs hover over each

Hikari no Matsuri -  Jingle Bell Donation Event Tent
   This is a small tent just north of the central staging area of the
boardwalk, and as such, is significantly dwarfed by it.  Two separate flaps
lead off to different sections of the tent, at opposing corners: a red
one to the northwest and a blue one to the northeast.  A large
archway in the tent opens further and wider to the north, leading into an
even bigger partition.

  Strangely larger than the room preceding it, this section of the
donation event tent is dedicated to the Red Team, offering a small bastion
of privacy as well as the location of their donation bin.  Nobody is allowed
in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,
so you're safe from all the hullabaloo of the festival proper if you need a

  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its

Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Peaceful Town, Mabe Village
  A dirt road leads in from the north here, heading both east and west as
it enters this small village.  A large house stands in the middle of this
plot of land, a doghouse affixed to its side.  The ground is well-traveled,
but weeds spring up in the margins all around.

  A break between the trees reveals a slightly overgrown path heading
northwards from this unkempt field between houses.  Wildflowers spring from
the soil everywhere, varied in hue and shape.  An earthen path leads through
this section of the village, running from east to west.

Outside a Cottage, Mabe Village
  An unpainted picket fence surrounds a quaint cottage here, one section
replaced by the trunk of a leafy beech tree.  The grass between the fence
and the house is wild and untrimmed, while a dirt path leads through a gap
in the fence directly towards the cottage's door.  The other end of the path
leads off to the west.

Before a Home, Mabe Village
  This field has been mowed down only around this house, small pathway
leading toward the door.  A few old wooden boxes are broken open and in
disrepair against the outside walls, likely falling apart if attempted to be
picked up.  A single planter box is against the house, raised up slightly,
but overgrown and unkempt.  The village leads out in all directions except
the east, where the forest lies.

  Held up by a few metal poles, a large canvas tent with open sides holds a

  Drilled right into solid rock, a doorway has been constructed in the side

McNeil Woods - Split Path
  Trees, shrubs, bushes, and other such indigenous wildlife completely
surround the area.  Birds singing in the trees, animals sniffing through the

one were to take a moment to peer through the trees, the dark form of what
could be a cabin can be made out.  Northwest takes the dirt path on inside

McNeil Woods - Split Path
  Trees, shrubs, bushes, and other such indigenous wildlife completely
surround the area.  Birds singing in the trees, animals sniffing through the
bushes, and some other sounds not so readily identified.  To the south, if
one were to take a moment to peer through the trees, the dark form of what
could be a cabin can be made out.  Northwest takes the dirt path on inside
McNeil Woods, while northeast leads toward the eastern most entrance.

McNeil Woods - Fork in the Path
  The trail bends around a stand of oak, a few bushes and wild
mushrooms growing beneath their reaching limbs.  The path splits apart,
heading toward the northeast and northwest.  Northwest, the dirt path looks
to cut straight through what was once a hill, while northeast the trail
inclines as it climbs up on top of another.  The southern trail is
impassable and choked with briars.  Every other direction is blocked off
quite completely by a myriad of trees, fauna, and tall grasses.

McNeil Woods - Fork in the Path
  Trees dot the landscape all around, the only things daring enough to
grow anywhere near them are sparse bushes, variously colored mushrooms, and
grass.  The dirt path is free of any sort of obstructions.  No tree roots
jutt up, no rocks or loose pebbles, nor even a single leaf mar your way.  To
the northwest you can see what looks to be a cabin behind a short, shoddily
made wall.  The western path looks to follow a creek around the cabin.

McNeil Woods - Fork in the Path
  Trees dot the landscape all around, the only things daring enough to
grow anywhere near them are sparse bushes, variously colored mushrooms, and
grass.  The dirt path is free of any sort of obstructions.  No tree roots
jutt up, no rocks or loose pebbles, nor even a single leaf mar your way.  To
the northwest you can see what looks to be a cabin behind a short, shoddily
made wall.  The western path looks to follow a creek around the cabin.

trail and water save a few scant inches of grass.

  Nothing but grass grows in between the creek and the trail.  On the
other side of the path, however, there stands a line of pines, cedars, and
oaks, all barring the way to whatever may lay beyond them.  Across the
creek, the ground that cabin with the protective wall has risen steadily,
coming to form a wall of dirt and rock that the water laps at as it moves. 
To the southeast, the ground rises to cut the path away from the creek,
while northwest both creek and trail continue on their way together.

McNeil Woods - A Bend in the Path
  The grass has started to nip at the edges of the trail, beginning the
long task of taking the trail back from man.  Patches sprout up here and
there, eating away at the solidarity of the forest trail.  Northeast from

toward a goal you're not quite sure of.

see who it is that is passing their way now.  To the northwest you can just
barely hear the gurgle of water moving somewhere, while south continues on
relentlessly through the woods.

McNeil Woods - Northern Clearing
  Tall grass and open sky stretch out to the south, hedged in by the
surrounding wood and an old trail.  This clearing has an eerie sort of calm
about it.  None of the forest creatures leave the cover of the trees, and
even the less natural denizens of the area seem to steer clear for some
reason.  North from here the forest crowds close, giving way only for a
trail that heads out of the clearing.  The only other point of interest in
this open area would be the huge fallen tree to the east.

McNeil Woods - Along the Edge of the Clearing
  An apple tree has grown right in the middle of the trail, a living
testament toward the non-existent maintenance it receives.  Nevertheless,
the nature scorned path does continue on to the east and the west.  The rest

  This trail, unlike all of those back outside the glen, is ill-cared

the dirt path, and grass as started the slow process of taking the ground
back.  Nevertheless, what is left of the trail continues on east and west,

patches of dirt in the grass that has decided to take back some ground.  But
nevertheless, the trees block all directions save north west and east. 
Northeast leads out onto a solid path that runs as far back as you can see
in a straight line.  Northwest, on the other hand, leads out into a small

McNeil Woods - On Top of a Small Rise
  Here on this rise, you are elevated over everywhere else the path
runs.  You can see a log cabin a bit to the south, a dark form hunkering
down among the trees.  Northeast from here the trail makes a turn, though to
where isn't clear.  Southwest turns away the opposite direction, it too
getting lost among the trees and brush.  Southeast the trail drops down into
a shallow depression in the terrain.

far off to see.  Southeast, you can see that the trail runs straight back to
a tree line, no obstructions what so ever.  To the southwest, an offshoot
trail that travels down the side of the slight rise and on into a
vally/ditch sort of depression in the ground.

could be a cabin can be made out.  Northwest takes the dirt path on inside
McNeil Woods, while northeast leads toward the eastern most entrance.

McNeil Woods - An Incline
  The trail slopes gently here, the entrance to the northwest up on a
small rise.  To the south you can clearly tell there is a log cabin or some
kind of structure there.  The ground drops away behind it, creating a
depression, or shallow valley of sorts.  There is a path that leads into it
from somewhere east of here, but its hard to tell exactly how to get there.

McNeil Woods - A Ruins Basement
  This room is made up of grey cement walls and a rough stone floor.  There
are piles of already chopped firewood, a barrel of semi-fresh drinking
water, and then crates stacked up along the walls.  The room is in
surprisingly decent shape, considering the occupants of the cabin.

McNeil Woods - A Ruined Cabin
  This cabin is torn to pieces.  Bits of broken furniture are scattered
everywhere, as are piles of refuse, half-eaten food, and junk.  The windows
are broken out, the walls are cracked, and the floor is stained in several
places.  The door, the the southeast, has been ripped off its hinges
completely.  The only thing that seems to have been left whole is the ladder
in the back corner, leading down into a basement beneath the cabin.

  The trail slopes gently here, the entrance to the northwest up on a

depression, or shallow valley of sorts.  There is a path that leads into it
from somewhere east of here, but its hard to tell exactly how to get there.

Sulfataska Mountains - Hiking Trail
  Bisecting the vast grasslands, the dirt path continues to snake its way

of grass.  Thousands of blades of grass sprout up from the soft earth, as
they span out towards the far reaches of the horizon, blanketing the
delicate ground with a vivid layer of herbage - hued a vibrant emerald.  At
the southwestern end of the dirt path stands a stone arch, constructed from

BACKSTAB
syntax: backstab <target>

The backstab skill can be used only with short piercing weapons, and it
can only be used to initiate combat.  Backstabbing the opponent allows
delivery of a devastating blow, dealing several times normal damage. 
However, a failed backstab leaves the thief open to retaliation.  
 
Backstab does triple weapon damage plus the one eighth of the user's
level. It always hits against sleeping foes at 2% skill or better. But,
it cannot be used on foes already at 1/3 hp or below.
 
You must be HIDDEN or INVISIBLE to your opponent to sneak up on them.
 
Ninja learn this ability at level 30.

The Veldt - Fa'Diel Gate
  This is one of the eastern-most points of the Veldt.  It is the area
where the plains end and the forest begins.  There is a lot of barren soil
in this area, exposing stones and little patches of grass here and there. 
Southwest, the Veldt continues in full splendor.  A wide dirt path leads
northeast out of the fields and away from the southeastern forests toward a
large well-guarded gate, which appears one-way.

McNeil Woods - An Incline
  The trail slopes gently here, the entrance to the northwest up on a
small rise.  To the south you can clearly tell there is a log cabin or some
kind of structure there.  The ground drops away behind it, creating a
depression, or shallow valley of sorts.  There is a path that leads into it
from somewhere east of here, but its hard to tell exactly how to get there.

McNeil Woods - An Incline
  The trail slopes gently here, the entrance to the northwest up on a
small rise.  To the south you can clearly tell there is a log cabin or some
kind of structure there.  The ground drops away behind it, creating a
depression, or shallow valley of sorts.  There is a path that leads into it
from somewhere east of here, but its hard to tell exactly how to get there.

  The trail cuts right through what might have been a hill, The ground
raising well over head, taking all the grass, and wild life out of view.  If
you look, you can see some of the leafy branches sticking out over the
cliffs edge high above, but nothing else of the forest.  The dirt of the
cliffs is just a shade darker than the dirt of the path you are traveling, a
few wayward tree roots poking out from a wrong turn in their search of
water.  To the northwest the path splits in two, while to the southeast it

grow anywhere near them are sparse bushes, variously colored mushrooms, and

jutt up, no rocks or loose pebbles, nor even a single leaf mar your way.  To

McNeil Woods - Path Through the Hill
  The trail cuts right through what might have been a hill, The ground
raising well over head, taking all the grass, and wild life out of view.  If
you look, you can see some of the leafy branches sticking out over the
cliffs edge high above, but nothing else of the forest.  The dirt of the
cliffs is just a shade darker than the dirt of the path you are traveling, a
few wayward tree roots poking out from a wrong turn in their search of
water.  To the northwest the path splits in two, while to the southeast it
looks to toward the east.

McNeil Woods - Fork in the Path
  Trees dot the landscape all around, the only things daring enough to
grow anywhere near them are sparse bushes, variously colored mushrooms, and
grass.  The dirt path is free of any sort of obstructions.  No tree roots
jutt up, no rocks or loose pebbles, nor even a single leaf mar your way.  To
the northwest you can see what looks to be a cabin behind a short, shoddily
made wall.  The western path looks to follow a creek around the cabin.

GLADIATOR (Gla)
 
Gladiator is one of the two classes a Warrior may evolve to at level 30.
Gladiators utilize a variety of wrestling and martial arts moves to
perform combo attacks, and can unleash their own Super special move or
recite their personal Mantra. Because of their immense physical strength,
Gladiators prefer to brutally assault victims with styles like wrestling
which put their burly physiques to good use.
 
Note that Gladiators may benefit from putting %B in their prompts.

McNeil Woods - Alongside the Creek
  It looks like this path is either well used, or was intentionally dug
into the earth.  Ground stands three feet up from the trail to either side
of you, making the trees seem that much taller than they really are.  You
can hear the gurgle of the creek just beyond the elevated ground to the
north, and from the sound of it, you seem to be walking parallel to it.  The
east leads toward an intersection in the woodland path, while the west
follows the creek on around the outer wall of a cabin.

  The trail takes a turn here, the ground and trees guiding it where

dirt path follows right along the bank of the creek, nothing between the
trail and water save a few scant inches of grass.

NINJA (Nin)
 
The Ninja is one of two classes a Thief may evolve into at level 30.
Trained in sabotage, espionage, scouting, and assassination, their
expertise lies in doing a lot of damage and avoiding aggression
through stealth or hit-and-run tactics. Ninjas rely on quick
reflexes through their various reactionary abilities.
 
Skills: backstab, smokescreen, dual wield, shadow stalk,
        doppelganger, firetrap, fumes, double image, incite
Spells: Exit, Venom Saber, Fear, Leeches, Shadow Step, Phantom Cloak,
        Jutsu

BACKSTAB
syntax: backstab <target>

The backstab skill can be used only with short piercing weapons, and it
can only be used to initiate combat.  Backstabbing the opponent allows
delivery of a devastating blow, dealing several times normal damage. 
However, a failed backstab leaves the thief open to retaliation.  
 
Backstab does triple weapon damage plus the one eighth of the user's
level. It always hits against sleeping foes at 2% skill or better. But,
it cannot be used on foes already at 1/3 hp or below.
 
You must be HIDDEN or INVISIBLE to your opponent to sneak up on them.
 
Ninja learn this ability at level 30.

'SHADOW STALK'
syntax: none
 
Shadow stalk is a passive skill that permits the user to be more stealthy in
the dark. If the user is competent in shadow stalking, then neither hide nor
sneak will wear off on their own as long as the user remains in dark rooms.
 
Ninjas learn this ability at level 40.

McNeil Woods - Western Trail Along the Creek
  Nothing but grass grows in between the creek and the trail.  On the
other side of the path, however, there stands a line of pines, cedars, and
oaks, all barring the way to whatever may lay beyond them.  Across the
creek, the ground that cabin with the protective wall has risen steadily,
coming to form a wall of dirt and rock that the water laps at as it moves. 
To the southeast, the ground rises to cut the path away from the creek,
while northwest both creek and trail continue on their way together.

McNeil Woods - Western Trail Along the Creek
  Nothing but grass grows in between the creek and the trail.  On the
other side of the path, however, there stands a line of pines, cedars, and
oaks, all barring the way to whatever may lay beyond them.  Across the
creek, the ground that cabin with the protective wall has risen steadily,
coming to form a wall of dirt and rock that the water laps at as it moves. 
To the southeast, the ground rises to cut the path away from the creek,
while northwest both creek and trail continue on their way together.   
(] Exits: nw se [)
     The creek travels along sluggishly through a channel cut into the ground.

SENSE HIDDEN

The sense hidden skill provides the user with a chance to detect hidden
characters.  The user will have a chance to notice hidden characters
whenever he looks in a room.  Unlike other sources of detection, this skill
is never assured to work.  It may only reveal some or none of the characters
hidden in a room.  
 
Thieves learn this ability at level 15.

away from it, turning to the southwest, where it leads elsewhere.

McNeil Woods - A Bend in the Path
  The grass has started to nip at the edges of the trail, beginning the
long task of taking the trail back from man.  Patches sprout up here and
there, eating away at the solidarity of the forest trail.  Northeast from
here you can hear the gurgle of water, while southeast the trail pushes on
toward a goal you're not quite sure of.

McNeil Woods - Trail Through the Forest
  The trees have crowded close to the path, creating a naturally narrow
lane out here in the middle of the woods.  If one didn't know any better, it
would seem that this myriad of trees and plant life crowds the trail just to
see who it is that is passing their way now.  To the northwest you can just
barely hear the gurgle of water moving somewhere, while south continues on
relentlessly through the woods.

  Trees loom over the trail, their long leafy branches interweaving
over head to create a canopy of green.  Even so, the light from the sky
above is still able to filter through to the path below.  The trail is cut
north and south, no bends or twists.  Likewise, you can't really tell what
you will find going in either direction.

Truce - Quiet Path
  Ivy twists between the slats of a picket fence lining this road along the
city's outskirts.  The road empties into a weedy lawn, where stands a tall,
sighing willow whose sagging branches shade a cloistered building
underneath.  Aside from olive green shutters occluding its windows, the
building is drenched in pure white.

Truce - Southern Gate
  The well-kept road transforms into loose gravel and then into a dirt path
as it leads past the iron gates marking the southern extreme of Truce.  A
side path branches from it, trekking west along the city limits.  A large
sign hangs overhead, with 'TRUCE' written in fancy bold letters.  A guard
station stands to the east.

  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Kakariko Village - Entrance
  Two large logs hold up a wooden sign overhead as the forest thins out
into a grassy pathway that opens up into a village.  Bordering either side
of the entrance are large hills that have been intentionally cut through and
reinforced with rocks and wooden beams.  Plants have taken root in as many
openings as possible, creating beautiful, natural decoration around the
town.  Small shrubs and tall grass line the outer edges of the passage into
civilization, discouraged by travel in and out of town compacting the earth
through the village.  The village continues to open up toward the northeast,
while the forest lies back to the west.

Some intentionally well-groomed trees stand proudly in a decorative fashion in the middle of the pathway, here, polite and tamed, quite unlike the trees of the forest beyond the southwest.

Kakariko Village - Midway on the Tower
  The tower looms overhead still here at the midway point on the ladder. From here, it's possible to see a decent amount of the town, but surely the view from the top will be quite revealing.

Kakariko Village - Atop the Watchtower
  It's possible to see quite a-ways around the village from the top of this tower, including most of the rooftops. The breeze is just a bit harsher up here, and it's possible to get a peek of the ocean shore to the north, beyond the hillside. The graveyard to the of the village is just barely noticable as well, mostly shrouded by steep mountainsides and trees. The exit of the village to the east is noticably less green than the village, while the exit toward the west is swimming in trees.

Kakariko Village - Town Pathway
  The village's watch tower is here, accessible to anyone able to climb a ladder. Its top is high up and out of sight. Weeds and grass are overgrown at its base, while the rest of passage around town seems well trimmed. The dirt walls open toward the north, where further still, stairs are visible. The rest of town opens toward the east.

Kakariko Village - Headin' to the Shore, Stairs Up
  The town windmill towers overhead, inaccessible from here, upon the very top of the hill. The cut out walls surround this point, stacked with rocks and wooden beams, as well as large, metal beams, requiring extra support to ensure the windmill above does not topple. Stairs lead up, eventually allowing access to the windmill, while the pathway continues normally to the south toward the rest of the village.

Kakariko Village - Town Pathway
  The hills even out, up here, finally giving way to the view of the landscape beyond the village, if only to the north. The way down is very steep, but the ocean and shore unfold not too far beyond the village gates. The windmill can be seen here, creaking gently as it turns, looking over the village. The path continues to the north, the only way to the windmill, while stairs lead back down toward the bulk of the town.

Kakariko Village - Town Pathway
  The creaking of the windmill is quite strong here, as it lies directly to the east, along with a door allowing access into it. A small fence borders the hillside dropoff to the north, which is also lined with a good number of crates. Plants are growing well here, seeing sunlight quite frequently. An opening in the fence allows travel northeast, which leads mostly downhill away from the village and toward the shoreline. Otherwise, heading south leads further into civilization.

Kakariko Village - Town Pathway
  The creaking of the windmill is quite strong here, as it lies directly to the east, along with a door allowing access into it. A small fence borders the hillside dropoff to the north, which is also lined with a good number of crates. Plants are growing well here, seeing sunlight quite frequently. An opening in the fence allows travel northeast, which leads mostly downhill away from the village and toward the shoreline. Otherwise, heading south leads further into civilization.

  The hills even out, up here, finally giving way to the view of the landscape beyond the village, if only to the north. The way down is very steep, but the ocean and shore unfold not too far beyond the village gates. The windmill can be seen here, creaking gently as it turns, looking over the village. The path continues to the north, the only way to the windmill, while stairs lead back down toward the bulk of the town.

Kakariko Village - Town Pathway
  The creaking of the windmill is quite strong here, as it lies directly to the east, along with a door allowing access into it. A small fence borders the hillside dropoff to the north, which is also lined with a good number of crates. Plants are growing well here, seeing sunlight quite frequently. An opening in the fence allows travel northeast, which leads mostly downhill away from the village and toward the shoreline. Otherwise, heading south leads further into civilization.

Kakariko Village - Town Pathway
  The hills even out, up here, finally giving way to the view of the landscape beyond the village, if only to the north. The way down is very steep, but the ocean and shore unfold not too far beyond the village gates. The windmill can be seen here, creaking gently as it turns, looking over the village. The path continues to the north, the only way to the windmill, while stairs lead back down toward the bulk of the town.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches.

all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

is practical and is frequently visited by adventurous citizens before their

  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of

either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet

Booster Tower - Closet
  This room is rather cramped, just one tiny window overlooking the trees
far below.  There is nothing of interest here, this closet not being used
for storage of any kind, but almost like an office.  The only exit is
through the door, to the south.

Booster Tower - Battle Room
  This room is large and wide open with many of the usual tiles spread
across the floor.  However, some of the tiles seem loose and suspicious,
like something is hiding underneath.  A hallway continues to the west of the
room and there is a doorway to the far north.

Booster Tower - Who-knows-what Floor...
  It's unclear how high up in the tower, exactly, this floor is. There are no elevators and the stairs are tedious, not to mention unsafe. In fact, it appears that heading down the stairs here will make one unable to return upwards, as the stairs have a huge gap in them.

the opposite ends of the room are on display, while loud music can be heard
echoing from downstairs.

Northern Path, Mabe Village
  A dirt road leads in from the north right to the edge of a small cliff. 
Directly below, the open mouth of a large well can be seen.  The road leads
into a small village directly to the east, surrounded by leafy trees on all
sides, clearly visible from this hill.  A wooden sign has been planted in
the ground as well.

Madam Meowmeow's Home, Mabe Village
  Wooden planks cover the inside of this home, made from high-quality woods

Side Yard, Mabe Village
  A break between the trees reveals a slightly overgrown path heading
northwards from this unkempt field between houses.  Wildflowers spring from
the soil everywhere, varied in hue and shape.  An earthen path leads through
this section of the village, running from east to west.

  An unpainted picket fence surrounds a quaint cottage here, one section
replaced by the trunk of a leafy beech tree.  The grass between the fence
and the house is wild and untrimmed, while a dirt path leads through a gap
in the fence directly towards the cottage's door.  The other end of the path

  This overgrown field has a good mix of plant life and an attractive
combination of colors present in its myrad flowers, weeds, and grasses.  A

neighbors to expose their leaves to the sky.  More of the village lies

Before a Home, Mabe Village
  This field has been mowed down only around this house, small pathway
leading toward the door.  A few old wooden boxes are broken open and in
disrepair against the outside walls, likely falling apart if attempted to be
picked up.  A single planter box is against the house, raised up slightly,
but overgrown and unkempt.  The village leads out in all directions except

  Held up by a few metal poles, a large canvas tent with open sides holds a

Eastern Entrance to McNeil Woods
  Expanding all out before you is Mcneil Woods.  Countless numbers of
trees, lush grass, patches of mushrooms, and vibrantly-colored flowers are
spread everywhere.  One can hear the wildlife going about it's daily
business, not disturbed by your presence at all.  It would seem that the
forest is quite used to interaction with humans and those like them.  All in
all, this place is beautiful, and has a good feel about it.

  Trees, shrubs, bushes, and other such indigenous wildlife completely
surround the area.  Birds singing in the trees, animals sniffing through the
bushes, and some other sounds not so readily identified.  To the south, if
one were to take a moment to peer through the trees, the dark form of what
could be a cabin can be made out.  Northwest takes the dirt path on inside

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature

Oriental Town, Wutai - Southern Gate
  A tall stone wall bounds Wutai on the southern side, with a pair of
enormous wooden gates, reinforced with steel, set into it.  The gates are
currently wide open, and guarded by a single man.  The gate stands more than
tall enough for most creatures to be let through, and seems to dwarf anyone
standing in them.  The road which runs into the city is made from
densely-packed, brown-colored cobblestones, with shallow ruts on either side
where carts have worn them down.

there are no vehicles or draft animals anywhere to be seen, and the city is

off and occupied by a small but impressive-looking brick building labeled as
a bank.  A half-dozen black iron streetlamps, with a flame powered by an
unknown source, provide a soft, warm light at night.  A flight of wide stone
stairs lead up a hill to the east, which has several buildings on top of it.

  A haze of incense smoke clouds this room, deep and fragrant.  The walls

entire room is full of things, supposed to be magical; old furniture,
clothes, tarnished silver, bits of jewelery, all stacked on top of each
other, with only narrow gaps between the piles to allow people to walk
through.  Against the western wall sits a large glass counter, displaying a
variety of more useful items; rings, wands, and scrolls.

Wutai - Magishop
  A haze of incense smoke clouds this room, deep and fragrant.  The walls
are painted a deep purple, and the floor is made of wooden planks, but the
entire room is full of things, supposed to be magical; old furniture,
clothes, tarnished silver, bits of jewelery, all stacked on top of each
other, with only narrow gaps between the piles to allow people to walk
through.  Against the western wall sits a large glass counter, displaying a
variety of more useful items; rings, wands, and scrolls.  
(] Exits: south [)
(Charmed) A beast tied to a chain is chomping away, connected to Mechanus.
A hooded figure stands behind the counter, occupied with some kind of crystal.

ones in the plaza below.  The building to the north is labeled as a
Magishop, while the one to the south has a sign marking it as a weapons
outlet.  The road continues to the east.

Wutai - Uptown
  A sort of brick-paved plaza opens up here, merging with the road entering
from the south.  Shaped like a vague diamond, with the north point clipped
off and occupied by a small but impressive-looking brick building labeled as
a bank.  A half-dozen black iron streetlamps, with a flame powered by an
unknown source, provide a soft, warm light at night.  A flight of wide stone
stairs lead up a hill to the east, which has several buildings on top of it.
(] Exits: north east south [)
     Several stone benches have been erected here for weary travellers.
     A fountain made from concrete sits in the middle of the plaza, spewing several jets of water.

Guardia - A Field of Stumps
  The industry and inhabitants of Truce have deforested this area, using
the lumber to build and heat their homes, among other things.  The gates of
Truce open up to the east, shaded by several large oaks which have been left
for just that purpose, while a road runs through this field into the west. 
A large sign is posted by the path to the north, which leads into a
forest.

Guardia - A Grassy Field
  Outside the limits of Truce begins a vast field stretching into the
horizon.  The grass is trimly mowed right outside the gates, but grows more
unkempt as one walks west.  Butterflies flit about in the air, moving among
the blades.  A dirt road begins at the gate, well-maintained at the start
but gradually degrading to a simple trail.

Pioneer 2 - Shopping District
  The entryway into the shopping district is a wide but somewhat long
corridor leading away from the main street of the station and into the
underway of a round-capped building.  Bright signs line the walls,
enlightening visitors on the newest selections and never-let-you-down
gadgets the businesses presumably offer, and a metallic stand-up prop of a
large yellow bird sits off to one side, staring blankly at those who walk
by.  Immediately ahead, a large room is divided into three sections, each
one professed with its own pictorial label.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     A small satchel sits here, of a slightly sticky, silken substance.
A mustachioed musician cranks a music box here, monkey perched on his shoulder.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Hikari no Matsuri - Prize Exchange Hall: Voucher Redeemer
  Various machines in the area continue to buzz, beep, whir and boop as
many people cash in their Festival winnings for neat prizes and trinkets.  A
white sign hangs on the wall directly above one such machine, here,
offering insight on its inner workings.

  This is the inside of a nondescript gray cube.
(] Exits: west [)
     A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
     Several boxy steel lockers have been installed along the wall.

Asmodeus vanishes in a puff of red frost!

Hikari no Matsuri - Red Team's Base
  Strangely larger than the room preceding it, this section of the
donation event tent is dedicated to the Red Team, offering a small bastion
of privacy as well as the location of their donation bin.  Nobody is allowed
in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,
so you're safe from all the hullabaloo of the festival proper if you need a
moment to catch your bearings.

Hikari no Matsuri -  Jingle Bell Donation Event Tent
   This is a small tent just north of the central staging area of the
boardwalk, and as such, is significantly dwarfed by it.  Two separate flaps
lead off to different sections of the tent, at opposing corners: a red
one to the northwest and a blue one to the northeast.  A large
archway in the tent opens further and wider to the north, leading into an
even bigger partition.

Hikari no Matsuri - Prize Exhange Hall
  Spread out over a way-too-large-to-be-inside-a-tent room, a little over
half a dozen different machines are lined up in compartmentalized rooms,
each one serving a different purpose.  Hanging signs hover over each
cubicle-like division, offering instructions for each one along the way.

Participate in the Donation & Starlight Shower events!
Give extra Jingle Bells to the Donation Bins located in
your team's base to contribute toward the Festival Donation
Event!  At specific donation amount thresholds, you and
everyone on your team will win a prize! Check back here
often to push the button and see if your team has reached
any recent threshold tiers!
Starlight Showers will happen on occasion during the Festival
of lights, raining down motes of light!  Collect these motes
when they fall and give them to your team's Donation Bin to
count toward your team's overall total! Toward the end of the
last day of the Festival, the team with the most motes will
win a prize (though the runner-up will receive a prize, too!)

Toward the end of the Festival of Lights, a portion of the donated
Jingle Bells will be divided up between all participating members
of each team and then handed out as a redistribution.

Once the announcement has been made (watch the [FEST] channel or
ask someone if they've seen it!), please touch the light pad on the
wall to receive both your prize for the Starlight Showers event
and also to receive your share of the redistribution!

   This is a small tent just north of the central staging area of the

lead off to different sections of the tent, at opposing corners: a red
one to the northwest and a blue one to the northeast.  A large
archway in the tent opens further and wider to the north, leading into an

  Strangely larger than the room preceding it, this section of the
donation event tent is dedicated to the Red Team, offering a small bastion
of privacy as well as the location of their donation bin.  Nobody is allowed
in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,
so you're safe from all the hullabaloo of the festival proper if you need a

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

     A leather backpack, waiting to be stuffed full of cargo, lies here.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     A small satchel sits here, of a slightly sticky, silken substance.
A mustachioed musician cranks a music box here, monkey perched on his shoulder.

Asmodeus vanishes in a puff of red frost!

Hikari no Matsuri - Red Team's Base
  Strangely larger than the room preceding it, this section of the
donation event tent is dedicated to the Red Team, offering a small bastion
of privacy as well as the location of their donation bin.  Nobody is allowed
in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,
so you're safe from all the hullabaloo of the festival proper if you need a
moment to catch your bearings.   
(] Exits: north se [)
     A large painting of the Midnight City, Viorar, hangs here.
     A large painting of the Free City, Truce, hangs here.

Hikari no Matsuri -  Jingle Bell Donation Event Tent
   This is a small tent just north of the central staging area of the
boardwalk, and as such, is significantly dwarfed by it.  Two separate flaps
lead off to different sections of the tent, at opposing corners: a red
one to the northwest and a blue one to the northeast.  A large
archway in the tent opens further and wider to the north, leading into an
even bigger partition.

Hikari no Matsuri - Prize Exhange Hall
  Spread out over a way-too-large-to-be-inside-a-tent room, a little over
half a dozen different machines are lined up in compartmentalized rooms,
each one serving a different purpose.  Hanging signs hover over each
cubicle-like division, offering instructions for each one along the way.

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.

Onrac - Village Cemetary
  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.

  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a
northern church, the western entrance of the village proper, and the general
rest of the village to the south.  Cries of seagulls punctuate the
west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear
blue sky.

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.

  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its

Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

     Several boxy steel lockers have been installed along the wall.
     A box rests on the counter, potentially full of missing things.
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

[Player Housing] A Black Mage's Abode
  This is the inside of a nondescript gray cube.

     Several boxy steel lockers have been installed along the wall.
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.  
(] Exits: north west [)
A man shrouded in a dark blue robe and a pointed hat awaits your request.
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the east.

Onrac - Village Cemetary
  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.  
(] Exits: south west [)
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the south.

Onrac - Crossroads
  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a
northern church, the western entrance of the village proper, and the general
rest of the village to the south.  Cries of seagulls punctuate the
west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear
blue sky.  
(] Exits: [north] east south west [)
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the east.

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.  
(] Exits: north east [)
     A vivid pink warp pipe juts out of the ground, leading somewhere!
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the east.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
     A Christmas tree stands here, adorned with holiday decorations.
[AFK] Rincewind is sleeping on a fountainside bench.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.
[AFK] Elisius _ is here.
Tiny electric lights blink and flicker up and down the street.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     A small satchel sits here, of a slightly sticky, silken substance.
A mustachioed musician cranks a music box here, monkey perched on his shoulder.
Tiny electric lights blink and flicker up and down the street.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.  
(] Exits: east [)
     A pair of spider fangs have been left here, dripping with black ichor.
     A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
     Several boxy steel lockers have been installed along the wall.
     A box rests on the counter, potentially full of missing things.
[AFK] (Pink Aura) Gforte - Rising Rage is here.
The Truce Banker is here behind a counter.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Truce - East of Fountain
  A sandy cobblestone path sashays toward the harbor under the shade of two
rows of poplar trees.  A salty breeze gusts down the path, tossing up swirls
of fluttering leaves.  East, a pier extends over the sea.  
(] Exits: east west [)
     A thin cloth shirt is crumpled into a pile here, looking rather flimsy and discarded.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

Truce - Pier
  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet
chatter from ten feet below.

Truce - Pier
  The pier turns a corner here, offering an unobstructed view of the
endless waves lazily rolling across the Western Sea.  In the opposite
direction, the homes and shops of Truce stand all abreast along the
coastline.  A fixed telescope is bolted into the corner of the pier,
pointing northeast.

  A large docking station marks the end of the pier.  Several docking
cleats and bollards line the eastern edge, in various stages of rust from
the endless waves and mist.  A single streetlamp stands at the terminus of
the pier, brimming over a few benches for those anticipating the return of a
familiar face.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.
(] Exits: north south [)
     A pale bluish-green roll of parchment sits on the floor.
     A psychedelic-patterend truffle with a magic glow sits here.
     A rolled-up bit of parchment is here, sporting an armor seal.
     (37) A packed ball of snow is lying here, waiting to be tossed.
     A large statue of a snake spills a limitless amount of nourishing liquid from its mouth.
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
     A Christmas tree stands here, adorned with holiday decorations.
Tiny electric lights blink and flicker up and down the street.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     A small satchel sits here, of a slightly sticky, silken substance.
A mustachioed musician cranks a music box here, monkey perched on his shoulder.
Tiny electric lights blink and flicker up and down the street.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.  
(] Exits: east [)
     ( 3) A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
     A pair of spider fangs have been left here, dripping with black ichor.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

Hikari no Matsuri - Red Team's Base
  Strangely larger than the room preceding it, this section of the
donation event tent is dedicated to the Red Team, offering a small bastion
of privacy as well as the location of their donation bin.  Nobody is allowed
in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,
so you're safe from all the hullabaloo of the festival proper if you need a
moment to catch your bearings.

Hikari no Matsuri -  Jingle Bell Donation Event Tent
   This is a small tent just north of the central staging area of the
boardwalk, and as such, is significantly dwarfed by it.  Two separate flaps
lead off to different sections of the tent, at opposing corners: a red
one to the northwest and a blue one to the northeast.  A large
archway in the tent opens further and wider to the north, leading into an
even bigger partition.

This old manuscript will teach you the benefits of using a staff (or just
long sticks in general), so much so that it will also confer benefits in the
same process!  Any long-bashing weapon that this book is used on will
obtain a sizeable Magroll bonus.  No other weapon types will qualify!  
 
Only one Mage's Insight bonus can be applied to a single long-bashing weapon

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.  
(] Exits: north west [)
A man shrouded in a dark blue robe and a pointed hat awaits your request.

Onrac - Village Cemetary
  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.

Onrac - Crossroads
  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a
northern church, the western entrance of the village proper, and the general
rest of the village to the south.  Cries of seagulls punctuate the
west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear
blue sky.

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
     A Christmas tree stands here, adorned with holiday decorations.

Truce - East of Fountain
  A sandy cobblestone path sashays toward the harbor under the shade of two
rows of poplar trees.  A salty breeze gusts down the path, tossing up swirls
of fluttering leaves.  East, a pier extends over the sea.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

Truce - Pier
  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet
chatter from ten feet below.

  The pier turns a corner here, offering an unobstructed view of the
endless waves lazily rolling across the Western Sea.  In the opposite
direction, the homes and shops of Truce stand all abreast along the
coastline.  A fixed telescope is bolted into the corner of the pier,
pointing northeast.

  A large docking station marks the end of the pier.  Several docking
cleats and bollards line the eastern edge, in various stages of rust from
the endless waves and mist.  A single streetlamp stands at the terminus of
the pier, brimming over a few benches for those anticipating the return of a
familiar face.

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

Asmodeus vanishes in a puff of red frost!

Hikari no Matsuri - Red Team's Base
  Strangely larger than the room preceding it, this section of the
donation event tent is dedicated to the Red Team, offering a small bastion
of privacy as well as the location of their donation bin.  Nobody is allowed
in here who doesn't own a badge denoting them as a member of the Red Team,
so you're safe from all the hullabaloo of the festival proper if you need a
moment to catch your bearings.

Hikari no Matsuri -  Jingle Bell Donation Event Tent
   This is a small tent just north of the central staging area of the
boardwalk, and as such, is significantly dwarfed by it.  Two separate flaps
lead off to different sections of the tent, at opposing corners: a red
one to the northwest and a blue one to the northeast.  A large
archway in the tent opens further and wider to the north, leading into an
even bigger partition.

Hikari no Matsuri - Prize Exhange Hall
  Spread out over a way-too-large-to-be-inside-a-tent room, a little over
half a dozen different machines are lined up in compartmentalized rooms,
each one serving a different purpose.  Hanging signs hover over each
cubicle-like division, offering instructions for each one along the way.

has 10 AC across the board, increases Mana by 250 and increases Magroll by
10.  It is also remortable, which means that acquiring it when you are lower
than level 90 will not cause it to disappear from your inventory when you
log out of the game.

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.

Onrac - Elena's White Magic
  A steepled building along the path rises two stories into the sky,
adorned with various religious designations of varying faiths.  Dual crosses
form the handles of a large door that is, at the moment, shut tightly, and
stained glass windows reflect against incoming sunlight.  An open gazebo of
ivory and brass holds a cart that appears to be loaded down with books and
scrolls.

Onrac - Village Cemetary
  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.

Onrac - Crossroads
  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a
northern church, the western entrance of the village proper, and the general
rest of the village to the south.  Cries of seagulls punctuate the
west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear
blue sky.

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
     A Christmas tree stands here, adorned with holiday decorations.
Tiny electric lights blink and flicker up and down the street.

Truce - East of Fountain
  A sandy cobblestone path sashays toward the harbor under the shade of two
rows of poplar trees.  A salty breeze gusts down the path, tossing up swirls
of fluttering leaves.  East, a pier extends over the sea.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

Truce - Pier
  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet
chatter from ten feet below.

Truce - Pier
  The pier turns a corner here, offering an unobstructed view of the
endless waves lazily rolling across the Western Sea.  In the opposite
direction, the homes and shops of Truce stand all abreast along the
coastline.  A fixed telescope is bolted into the corner of the pier,
pointing northeast.

Truce - Pier
  A large docking station marks the end of the pier.  Several docking
cleats and bollards line the eastern edge, in various stages of rust from
the endless waves and mist.  A single streetlamp stands at the terminus of
the pier, brimming over a few benches for those anticipating the return of a
familiar face.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.

[Player Housing] Slurmp's Dazzling Abode
  This room's architect was clearly well-aware of the dangers posed by irresponsible letter manipulation, because there's barely an un-adjectivized noun present. The walls are a putrid plaid, the ceiling holds a whirling disco ball, and even the bed is 'comfortable looking' ('bed' is notably resistant to most removal techniques, anyways). A poster of Atlantida fills the wall and seems to be watching you. Otherwise, there's not much here.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.
(] Exits: north south [)
     A pale bluish-green roll of parchment sits on the floor.
     A psychedelic-patterend truffle with a magic glow sits here.
     A rolled-up bit of parchment is here, sporting an armor seal.
     (37) A packed ball of snow is lying here, waiting to be tossed.
     A large statue of a snake spills a limitless amount of nourishing liquid from its mouth.
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.
(] Exits: north south [)
     A pale bluish-green roll of parchment sits on the floor.
     A psychedelic-patterend truffle with a magic glow sits here.
     A rolled-up bit of parchment is here, sporting an armor seal.
     (37) A packed ball of snow is lying here, waiting to be tossed.
     A large statue of a snake spills a limitless amount of nourishing liquid from its mouth.
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

[Player Housing] Slurmp's Dazzling Abode
  This room's architect was clearly well-aware of the dangers posed by irresponsible letter manipulation, because there's barely an un-adjectivized noun present. The walls are a putrid plaid, the ceiling holds a whirling disco ball, and even the bed is 'comfortable looking' ('bed' is notably resistant to most removal techniques, anyways). A poster of Atlantida fills the wall and seems to be watching you. Otherwise, there's not much here.

[Player Housing] Slurmp's Dazzling Abode
  This room's architect was clearly well-aware of the dangers posed by irresponsible letter manipulation, because there's barely an un-adjectivized noun present. The walls are a putrid plaid, the ceiling holds a whirling disco ball, and even the bed is 'comfortable looking' ('bed' is notably resistant to most removal techniques, anyways). A poster of Atlantida fills the wall and seems to be watching you. Otherwise, there's not much here.

[Player Housing] Slurmp's Dazzling Abode
  This room's architect was clearly well-aware of the dangers posed by irresponsible letter manipulation, because there's barely an un-adjectivized noun present. The walls are a putrid plaid, the ceiling holds a whirling disco ball, and even the bed is 'comfortable looking' ('bed' is notably resistant to most removal techniques, anyways). A poster of Atlantida fills the wall and seems to be watching you. Otherwise, there's not much here.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

You walk through a painting of Wutai and find yourself somewhere else...

Oriental Town, Wutai - Southern Gate
  A tall stone wall bounds Wutai on the southern side, with a pair of
enormous wooden gates, reinforced with steel, set into it.  The gates are
currently wide open, and guarded by a single man.  The gate stands more than
tall enough for most creatures to be let through, and seems to dwarf anyone
standing in them.  The road which runs into the city is made from
densely-packed, brown-colored cobblestones, with shallow ruts on either side
where carts have worn them down.  
(] Exits: north south [)
A light brown-colored moogle, carrying a polearm, is here.
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard has arrived through a painting of Wutai.

  A wide stone road runs here, splitting to the north and south and west. 
Gravel and some small plants surround it and lie in the corners with a large
city gate opening to the north.  South and west run alongside a rocky beach,
which wraps around into a penninsula to the south.  There is also a very
large pier to the south with many unusual structures on it.

Guardia - On the Peninsula
  A rocky peninsula juts out into the sea here, with water on the eastern
and western sides, while to the north lies the oriental city of Wutai.  A
winding path leads to the east, towards more rugged terrain.  A large
pier housing many structures extends from the shore to the south.

Guardia - A Pebbly Beach
  Possibly from a past landslide, several wide tongues of dirt stretch over
the rocks here.  For every time the waves wash over them, some dirt is
pulled with the water back into the sea.  Some brackish grass grows here
too, and someone has taken the initiative to build a sandcastle on the dirt.

Moonlight City, Viorar - Fountain
  Placed in the center of the city known as Viorar is a large fountain
that serves as the crossroads of the various city alleys.  A faint breeze
shuttles in the salty scent of the western ocean, which seams with the
earthy cologne of the eastern mountains.  To the south is the medical
center, indicated by a large white cross.  A small path leads over a dense
lawn into a dojo to the west, while a bright light shines from within a
brick house directly east.  To the north is yet another building, though
much larger in size and tree-shaped, with many towers screwing out of the
sides of the upper levels.

  A peaceful path runs along the coast here, away from the city limits,
with a view of the night ocean to the west.  The cobblestone road leads over
a pass of crashing waves and jagged rocks via a stone bridge to the
southwest.  The road is lined by a green wooden picket fence, running
downhill here and southward where a great pier resides.  The northeast path
goes toward the city center where a large shimmering fountain can be seen as
well as a gigantic tree-shaped building.

  Two streets perpendicularly intersect here.  A peaceful path runs from

a bustling alley is to the east.  Water from the bay flows into the city
through some channels - bridges leading over them where they intersect the
roads.  A lamp post on either corner of the intersection illuminates a
yellow glow and a large signpost hangs from one of them.

  The small room, humbled by its plain appearance, serves as the office
of the ticketmaster.  On the west side of the room are a few benches laid
out in three rows and four columns, facing the wide landscape window to the
west, outlooking the pier and the ocean beyond.  On the east side of the
room is the large enclosed area of the ticket window, a long velvet rope
attached to a pole barrier of a line leading up to it.  On the northern wall
is a large bulletin board, citing all the departing times, trip lengths, and

Viorar - Pier
  The large city piers begin here and stretch further on to the west
where a variety of ships of all sizes are docked everywhere, grouped in
their own sections.  Most of the residential boats line along here, as close
to the city as possible.  To the north, planted within a small waterway is a
cubic white building.   
(] Exits: north east west down [)
     A black warp pipe is sticking out of the pier.
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the north.

Viorar - Pier
  The great pier continues to expand in both directions, and the crashing
waves are less noticeable against the humongous ships in these sectors, used
mostly to transport goods between other parts of the world.  The glimmering
of a lighthouse can be seen far north off in a distant rocky cliff.   
(] Exits: east west [)
A matango in a police cap wanders around the city.

  The pier ends here, but extends to the north and south, holding

large orange buoys bob up and down out at sea, signifying the sea limits.

Joel Island - Ocean Caves: Entrance
  The watery caverns of Joel Island begin to the east in the partially
submerged tunnel.  The sea flows through here deep into the stomach of the
island, carving away at it.  The outside of the entrance has a pair of
bright green flags hanging over it.  A large wooden pier originating from
the docks to the northwest leads into the caves eastward.

  The cavern widens to a very large area that stretches far to the south.
The area is split in half by a river that rushes southward at an alarmingly
fast rate.  It would be suicidal to try to cross these waters to a tunnel at
the end leading east.  The cave begins to slope as well, getting steeper to
the south, but no less slippery.  A stone platform runs along the wall with
a rusty metal guard rail attached to its edge.

  The climb upward to the south continues on, and the sounds of the water
and rock clashing constantly go on less noticed.  The ceiling of the large
chamber can be seen from here and it appears that the end of the climb is
not far.  A strong stream pushes along the east side of the area, splitting
this cavern in two parts.  Thick stone steps lead the way, but the water has

  This elevated side of the cavern appears symmetrical to the west.  A

Joel Island - Ocean Caves: Cavern Stream
  This elevated side of the cavern appears symmetrical to the west.  A
strong stream divides the sides, and there is a slight but slippery slope
going downhill to the north on both.  A path has been carved into the ground
here.  Short metal guard rails loop through its surface, leading north.

of fluttering leaves.  East, a pier extends over the sea.

Truce's fountain looks small, the harbor spreading wide beyond it.  A
billboard looms overhead, attached to a building aside the road.  There's no

Truce - Leene Square
  Situated on somewhat elevated ground, Leene Square offers a view of
neighboring Truce rooftops.  The square itself, which comprises the biggest

Some festive balloon animals have been tied to the trees.  The tent to the

Truce - Tent of Subsistence
  Azure fabric rises from the ground and ties together at the top of this
tent, giving shape and form to the shop.  Backpacks, rope, pans, and other
camping gear are seen laying about the tent's floor.  Though messy, the tent
is practical and is frequently visited by adventurous citizens before their
hikes through the nearby areas.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet

Brigantes Castle - Gateway of Kings
  At the bottom of a long and winding fight of stairs is a set of massive
double doors.  They are old and faded, but still etched with scenes
depicting great kings and large battles.  The walls are of cracked stone,
and the area before the doors is not much more than an empty well.  The
floor was once a cobbled pathway, and the cobblestones continue under the
gate. Stairs lead back up to the surface.

  The cold winds are all but still within this nestled corner of the jagged landscape. The mountains pile up, clustered heavily in nearly all directions, dissolving any hope of further travel, save for a single cave toward the northeast. A small break is visible through the eastern mountain wall, but otherwise there is nothing but snow to see here.

Guardia - Jagged Forest
  The mountainous region lends itself as a decent shield from the snowy winds, things actually calming down hidden between various tall, rocky covers. Only but a few sparse trees continue to make their homes here, the forest to the west all but fading into obscurity. While the winds are not as harsh, the snow still falls, the cold still enveloping the area tightly in its grip. Only a single, small gap can be reasonably traversed through the mountains toward the west.

  The trees begin to give way further ahead, their encroachment toward the west waning, though unfortunately their limelight is stolen by a creeping mountain range intent on creating an incredibly hazardous journey. The area is still enveloped in snow, cloaking the true nature of anything one might stumble upon. There is one decidedly small break through the uneven terrain, towards the northeast, while a hole that appears to have been created with dynamite is to the southeast.

  The snow-laden grove seems to almost shift and spread intentionally in effort to obscure its secrets from the world - the harsh, frigid winds swirling large amounts of falling snow all around, no spot safe from the piercing cold.

  The air here is bone-chillingly cold. Each breath would form an impressive cloud of steam if it weren't snowing profusely. The cold, wet flakes swirl about in an angry dance. The path continues deeper into the snow, however it is also veiled by the thick snow storm hanging over it, barely concealing a breach through the eastside of the pass.

  A trail winds back and forth through the snow, leading to an old stone
building at the top of the embankment.  It looks to have been a gatehouse of
some kind as the remains of ancient stone walls have crumbled next to it. 
The faded crest of a gothic 'B' over a hammer and a sword can be faintly
made out over the entrance to the gatehouse.  The snow forms another, more
narrow path down the slope to the southwest.

Madra Ice Field - Icebound Gate
  Here is a circular, frozen gate.  The massive ice door blocks the path
further into the northwestern forest.  The sparkling trees, once sparse,
have begun to thicken and make the eastern path more narrow.  The snow falls
in a constant white blanket, keeping this section of the field frozen.  To
the southwest, there is a snow drift and a frozen lake.

         [Searching descriptions for 'wall']
-------------------------------------------------------
 1  Madra Ice Field - Outside the Supply Tent - 1 room away                     
  Many wooden boxes have been covered with a tarp here, and another canvas
tarp has been drawn between the two piles as a makeshift tent.  The boxes
are marked as medical supplies, food, and arrows, nothing spectacular.  The
path hugs the wall here as the inhabitants of the camp clearly tried to
avoid the falling ice.  
 2  Madra Ice Field - Filaha Camp - 1 room away                                 
  This area is enclosed by the only standing wall in the ice field.  The
Filaha Order has set up their gold tents in a half-circle against it, trying
to shield themselves from the vast blizzard ravaging this area.  Shards of
ice whistle through the air, slicing down everything in its path.  The
western gate is blocked by a sparkling wall of force.  
 3  Madra Ice Field - Crystallized Forest - 2 rooms away                        
  Here, the sprawling ice field comes close to the outer stone wall.  It
seems a remaining circular wall still stands, enclosing the next part of the
field.  The stone doorway leading in has been blocked, however, by a
glistening wall of light.  The raging blizzard over this part of the ice
field seems to avoid the glowing barrier, which pulses to some strange beat.
 4  Madra Ice Field - Outside Denim's Tent - 2 rooms away                       
  Back to back with the Princess' tent to the southwest, this tent is
almost as large and just as battered by the blizzard.  No guards are
stationed outside, but the tracks worn into the snow suggest a recent
patrol.  The stone wall enclosing the camp curves here, directing the path
back to the entrance in both directions.  
 5  Madra Ice Field - Temple of Arctic - 7 rooms away                           
  The forest clings so tightly to the sides of the building rising ahead
that no other path can be seen.  The snowy path ends at a set of steps made
of shining, frozen ice.  At the top of the steps, a wide balcony makes up
the front of what would appear to be a large temple.  The rooftops are
carved like wicked ice spikes, and no windows mark the chilly, mighty walls.
A giant double door, bearing the symbol of a snowflake inside a circle,
stands imposingly in the base of the wall.  Thick mist seems to be rising
gently from the snow and trees, and swirling around the temple.  
 6  Madra Ice Field - Snow Plain - 9 rooms away                                 
  Drifting snow has caused this section of the hill to be slippery with
loose and fresh powder.  The path ascenders to the northeast and footsteps
trudge on to the northwest.  With no trees or snowy walls to protect this
section of the field, the chill is bitter and the falling snow stings
against bare skin.  
 7  Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch - 9 rooms away                               
  Snow has fallen in two large banks here, forming a frozen ditch to pass
through.  From here you can see across the rest of the ice field.  It looks
to be nothing but a vast plain of snow encircled by an ancient and destroyed
stone wall.  The field is so deeply frozen that a wall is quite redundant
protection for the area.  To the northwest is a deep crack in the snowy
earth.  
 8  Madra Ice Field - Snowy Embankment - 10 rooms away                          
  A trail winds back and forth through the snow, leading to an old stone
building at the top of the embankment.  It looks to have been a gatehouse of
some kind as the remains of ancient stone walls have crumbled next to it. 
The faded crest of a gothic 'B' over a hammer and a sword can be faintly
made out over the entrance to the gatehouse.  The snow forms another, more
narrow path down the slope to the southwest.  
 9  Madra Ice Field - Before a Dark Cave - 10 rooms away                        
  Running along the eastern side of the outer stone wall around the ice
field, this section of the path has only two exits.  To the southwest is
more freezing snow as you move further away from the wall.  To the north a
large hill has formed out of snow, and something or someone has hollowed it
out into a cavern.  
 10 Madra Ice Field - Crystal Cave - 11 rooms away                              
  The interior of this cave in the snow sparkles like diamonds.  The walls
have frozen over into glassy blue ice.  The ground is covered with frost,
forming a smooth and frozen layer like a freshly-waxed floor.  A chute or
tunnel of some sort leads through the snow and into the eastern wall, but it
is far too slippery and steep to climb up.  
 11 Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch - 11 rooms away                              
  The ditch takes a sharp curve here.  To the west is the icy mud patch,
and to the southwest is a frozen stream.  The snow has piled so high here
that it is not possible to look out across the field any longer.  It seems
the snow has begun to freeze from the bottom, threatening to harden it into
walls.  
 12 Madra Ice Field - Frozen Stream - 12 rooms away                             
  Crossing this frozen stream will prove to be very tricky indeed. 
Although the ice looks to be solid, most adventurers know better.  Walls of
snow rise around the northeast path.  To the southwest is a sheer wall of
ice.  The frozen stream continues to the east.  
 13 Madra Ice Field - Dragon Nest - 13 rooms away                               
  It is clear that this crystal cavern has been made into a dragon's nest. 
Large, smooth ledges in the ice make perfect lounging spots for more than
one dragon of decent size.  All of the ledges taper down to the center of
the cavern, which is a marked and cracked sheet of ice.  Under one of the
overhangs in the western wall, someone has left a burnt-out camp fire and a
thick roll of bedding.  
 14 Madra Ice Field - Frozen Stream - 13 rooms away                             
  The stream must be frozen several inches thick, but it is obvious that
there is still deadly cold water underneath.  A hole has been shattered in
the ice, where something has been fishing.  A faint trail has been worn into
the snow sloping upwards to the northwest.  The stream's path continues to
the west and to the east, though the eastern stream has been blocked by a
wall of ice.  
 15 Madra Ice Field - Wall of Ice - 13 rooms away                               
 16 Guardia - Jagged Forest - 13 rooms away                                     
  The forest stops abruptly as an impassable, towering rock wall smothered in fallen snow rises out of the ground to the east. It provides a small amount of reprieve from the ceaseless blizzard, but is mostly a huge inconvenience. The only option is to return back toward the west.
 17 Guardia - Snow-Cloaked Mountains - 17 rooms away                            
  The cold winds are all but still within this nestled corner of the jagged landscape. The mountains pile up, clustered heavily in nearly all directions, dissolving any hope of further travel, save for a single cave toward the northeast. A small break is visible through the eastern mountain wall, but otherwise there is nothing but snow to see here.
 18 Guardia - Deadlight Cave - 18 rooms away                                    
  The interior of this cave in the snow sparkles like diamonds.  The walls
have frozen over into glassy blue ice.  The ground is covered with frost,
forming a smooth and frozen layer like a freshly-waxed floor.  Several
hieroglyphs are visible behind the ice.  
 19 Brigantes Castle - Gateway of Kings - 19 rooms away                         
  At the bottom of a long and winding fight of stairs is a set of massive
double doors.  They are old and faded, but still etched with scenes
depicting great kings and large battles.  The walls are of cracked stone,
and the area before the doors is not much more than an empty well.  The
floor was once a cobbled pathway, and the cobblestones continue under the
gate. Stairs lead back up to the surface.
 20 Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 20 rooms away                            
  The cobbling of this stone road is ancient and chipped.  A piece of
wood hanging from a crumbling wall declares this circular road "Voodoo
Circle."  Small partitions are huddled together on both sides of the road
like houses and shops, making it appear as though a whole city once existed
inside these castle walls.  The ceiling is magically enchanted to always
look like the night sky, and bats flutter about in the darkness.   
 21 Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 21 rooms away                            
  The stone passageways encasing the city are icy cold.  There are
advantages to living inside an underground castle, but heat is not one of
them.  All of the buildings off this stretch of Voodoo Circle are garishly
lit with red lanterns and bobbing lights.  To the west is the main gate to
the castle, and the Circle continues to the northeast.  A door is carved in
the southern wall, as well as a window which is emitting pink fog.   
 22 Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 22 rooms away                            
  Each step makes a clicking sound against the rough cobbling of the
uneven floor.  Deep cracks line the walls in which triangular windows have
been placed equidistantly.  Although the castle is underground, and the
windows really view a wall of dirt and stone, they have been magically
enchanted like the ceiling to peer out into a starlit night.  To the
southwest and north, Voodoo Circle continues.   
 23 Brigantes Castle - The Resting Rat - 22 rooms away                          
  Long, luxurious couches of black leather stretch wall to wall here. 
The massive fireplace is shaped like a screaming face, with a blazing fire
built in its mouth.  Magically enchanted torches in the shape of bats fly
around the ceiling, keeping the darkness of the rest of the city at bay. 
Although well-used, the carpet is thick and plush.  A long, polished bar
encircles half of the room, opposite the couches and fireplace.   
 24 Brigantes Castle - Studious Scribery - 23 rooms away                        
  Wall to wall, this high-ceilinged room is covered with books. 
Bookcases line the room so tightly that no windows are shedding light upon
the impossible amount of text and students below.  Long wooden tables have
been placed near convenient ladders for the many scribes who come here in
their thirst for knowledge.  A giant painting has been hung at the far end
of the room, displaying the portrait of a beautiful blonde witch.   
 25 Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 23 rooms away                            
  Forming a wide archway to the east, the stone tiling of the castle
walls give way to a plain house door.  Bats flutter in the night here,
following the curve of Voodoo Circle to the south where there is litle
light.  Several small, unseen creatures go skittering along the curving
northwestern path into the darkness.  Tacked against the western wall is the
Brigantes bulletin board.   
 26 Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 23 rooms away                            
  Here, beneath the magically-projected night sky, several twisted trees
reach for the moon with their leafless branches.  Upon closer inspection,
they are cleverly-carved pillars, and help to support the ceiling under the
weight of the earth and snow above.  Careful, even stone placement makes the
south and northeast paths flow together in a gentle curve around the corner.
A heavy, inconspicious wooden door has been placed in the northwestern wall.
Empty Desc
 27 Brigantes Castle - Burial Chamber - 24 rooms away                           
  The aged hieroglyphs along the walls which bear the cracks and fading
of years are immediately eye-catching.  Golden rods, from which light, thin
streams of fluttering white cotton sway, are affixed to the walls to give
the silent place a haunting flow of movement.  Various urns of a rather
large stature have been placed around the room, hand-painted and once
luxurious decor but now aging like the hieroglyphics.  In the exact center
of the tomb, a foreboding sarcophagus lies with its lid slightly ajar.   
 28 Brigantes Castle - Sewers - 24 rooms away                                   
  The smaller northwest tunnel joins a major throughway here, the water
flowing in from the west at a rapid pace.  The torches on the walls have
burnt out along this stretch of sewers, but the moss growing on the cold
stone walls glows with a sickly green light, providing enough light to see,
even though it makes the atmosphere of the sewers that much more spooky.  
 29 Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 24 rooms away                            
  Lit with bat-shaped torches that flutter through the darkness, this
cobblestone pathway opens widely to the east as it approaches a busy street.
A heavy wooden door has been set in the western wall, well-cared for over
the years.  A wide window peers northern across what should be a blank stone
wall, but is instead the magically enchanted view of a forest in the night. 
A skeleton painted on the wall has been magically animated, and dances
around, clattering its bones together.   
 30 Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 25 rooms away                            
  Forming the top of a perfectly round hallway with the rest of the
Voodoo Circle continuing east and west, this hallway is especially wide. 
The dull brown cobblestones paving the street transition into shining stones
of deep onyx on the northern street.  A magical breeze blows through one of
the windows in the wall, completely artificial and not chilling at all. 
Because the dark castle is so far below the ground, all the windows have
been sealed with stone and enchanted like the ceiling to peer out into the
night sky.   
 31 Brigantes Castle - Monstrous Menagerie - 25 rooms away                      
  With such a squat ceiling, this building has had pits dug into the
floor in which pets awaiting a new home are held.  The walls are floor are
tiled with dark cobblestones, but the holding pens have been furnished to
the creatures' comfort.  Still, the room is in various states of disarray as
unruly pets knock over furniture and objects without discretion and winged
creatures flit around the lights.   
 32 Brigantes Castle - Sewers - 25 rooms away                                   
  The sewers abruptly end, water flowing in through a heavy grate on the
west wall.  The clear water appears to have been diverted from the nearby
Eriphia River given its frigid temperature, but it becomes dark and murky
upon entering the sewers proper.  Even if the sturdy metal bars didn't
prevent exit to the west, the currents are moving too fast and the water is
far too cold to allow further travel in that direction.   
 33 Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade - 26 rooms away                      
  Paved with deep ebony stones that reflect the starlight above, this
street glimmers sinisterly.  The corners of the walls are studded with stone
gargoyle heads and carved faces of humans in pain.  The statue of a
beautiful woman, wrapped in bat-like wings, levitates unassisted above and
lights the room with the fire eternally burning in its mouth.  To the south,
the street is cobbled with dull brown stones rather than the jet black
stones here.  To the east and west, the onyx pathway is paved.  To the
north, set of french doors is half-hanging open.   
 34 Brigantes Castle - Sewers - 27 rooms away                                   
  The sewers come to a major junction here, with a rusty metal platform
standing in the center of a circular room, the brackish water still visible
through small holes in the grating underfoot.  Several torches attached to
the walls of this room provide light, though they burn with a greenish flame
and produce greasy smoke.   
 35 Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade - 27 rooms away                      
  Chains are screwed into the walls here, restraining what would appear
to be hands reaching out of the walls.  In the palm of each hand is a small
purple flame, lighting this corridor with an eerie glow.  The onyx-studded
road subtly sparkles with muted tones of the fuschia fire.  To the east, a
floating statue illuminates the promenade.  To the northwest, the eerie path
comes to a sharp, angular junction.   
 36 Brigantes Castle - Luxurious Home - 27 rooms away                           
  Evidently, this is the gaudy home of some lavish individual, because it
has been festooned with satin drapes of all kinds.  Curtains over the
windowless walls cascade around immaculate white and pink roses, which are
growing elegantly from several curvaceous urns.  The canopy bed in the far
corner is almost collapsing under the weight of pink satin and fresh
flowers.  In fact, there are so many pillows on the bed, it's a mystery how
there is enough room for anyone to sleep in it.  A steaming tea kettle rests
on a lovely mahogany table, set amongst a set of unused china.  A pearly
door leads out onto the southern street.   
 37 Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade - 28 rooms away                      
  Grotesque stone carvings jut from the castle walls, terrifying
charicatures of screaming faces trying to break free.  Unlike the eastern
road, only a single torch-holding hand lights the passage.  A passage shoots
off at a sharp angle to the south, bypassing a door covered with cobwebs and
labeled BANK in several languages.  To the northeast and southeast,
Nightmare Promenade continues its circular flow.  To the north, a beastly
claw is lazily drifting about, clutching a Sorcery Street sign.  The sounds
of neighing and stamping seem to come from the west.   
 38 Brigantes Castle - Sewers - 28 rooms away                                   
  The tunnels here come to an abrupt halt at an inexplicable wall of
solid-looking rectangular stone blocks, closely fit together without even
any room for mortar.  The water in the shallow channel continues flowing
through a set of bars set down low, presumably to a destination further
onwards in the sewer system.  The dripping and splashing sounds of water
everpresent in the sewers seems a little quieter here.
A small sign on the wall says 'Come back later.'
 39 Brigantes Castle - Beastly Bank - 29 rooms away                             
  The most prominent architecture in the room are the metal bars behind
which the banker is protected.  They are formed like a spiderweb in front of
the counter through which citizens pass their money for safe deposit.  Real
spiders of the non-metal variety seem to have taken a liking to the
protective bars as well, spinning their own long-forgotten cobwebs among the
false gossamer.  The marble counter and floor are chipped and cracked, but
the massive stone vault in the back wall seems to be in perfect condition. 
A door with a bell attached to it leads back out onto the northern Nightmare
Promenade.   
 40 Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Stable - 29 rooms away                         
  This dark stables within the castle is comprised of even, crimson
stones and lovingly polished wood.  Several large stalls line each wall with
gold and silver-decorated feeding troughs.  On the far wall are hung several
fantastic bridles, some jewelled and some spiked; as well as several saddles
in a similar jewel-encrusted and spiked fashion, in gold and silver like the
troughs. A flickering torch affixed to the wall provides dim light.
 41 Brigantes Castle - Sewers - 29 rooms away                                   
  A steady flow of sewage gushes down a drain on the west wall, the
liquid occasionally turning red or purple and carrying unidentifiable bits
of gristle along with it.  Travelling further means hopping over the small
stream of disgusting fluid, while hoping none of it splashes up.  The bricks
in the opposite wall are scored and marked with scratches from clawed
creatures marking their territory.   
 42 Brigantes Castle - Sorcery Street - 30 rooms away                           
  Smooth, glittering tiles have been laid out on this stretch of Sorcery
Street.  The walls are also tiled here, reflecting a prism of rainbow colors
that illuminates the hallway.  Sounds of tinkling water, gentling rippling
from a fountain, entice listeners to the southwest passage.  To the east,
the ambient sounds of excited crowds resound over the flashing lights of
what can only be a casino.  Vases of red flowers set up along the northern
hallway, which leads off the main street.   
 43 Brigantes Castle - Sewers - 30 rooms away                                   
  This section of the sewers contains an old couch, thrown out as trash
and somehow having made its way into these subterranean tunnels.  It sits
against one wall as a decrepit throne, cushions marked with thousands of
scratches and worn stuffing poking out of larger tears.  A pile of worthless
objects forms a nest on its worn surface, plastic toys and shiny baubles
collected into a hoard.  The shadowy sewers seem particularly dark and
ominous here.
 44 Brigantes Castle - Mica Manufacturing - 30 rooms away                       
  This dark room is lit by a huge shelf on the north wall filled with
jars of varying sizes, containing pumpkins with different expressions carved
into them.  Several iron lanterns dangle from the ceiling emitting a similar
faint glow.  A large forge sits on the east side of the room, and a series
of work benches surround it.   
 45 Brigantes Castle - Sorcery Street - 30 rooms away                           
  Flowing in a constant stream of garnet, a waterfall of blood beyond the
stained glass window here fills the passage with the sound of rushing water.
Light shining through the same window illuminates the passage with a calm,
crimson glow.  Millions of golden sparkles trail along the grown to the
southeast and north.  Sprawling vines, left unchecked to entangle the wall,
have conquered the western side of the passage.  The vines are not ivy,
however - they are pumpkin vines, and bear a single ripe pumpkin above the
western door.   
 46 Brigantes Castle - Killer Kitchen - 30 rooms away                           
  A polished white counter, held up by legs comprised of the bones of
some unfortunate creature, sits here with a menu list on it.  Visible beyond
the counter is a kitchen full of life and chaos.  Steam shoots out of a
random pipe in the wall fairly often and the grill in the back shoots flames
into the air on occasion.  Several overhead racks are attached to the
ceiling, dangling bright copper pans and pots beneath a singular, giant fan.
 47 Brigantes Castle - Fiendish Forge - 31 rooms away                           
   Dominated by the huge iron cauldron in the center of the floor, this
shop with a high ceiling is filled with a heavy fog, which is somehow
simultaneously nauseating and invigorating.  Numerous workbenches line the
stone walls, all covered with a variety of containers, stains, and
alchemical reagents.  A massive wooden door stands open to the north.   
 48 Brigantes Castle - Sorcery Street - 31 rooms away                           
  Above all else, the revolving glass door to the south catches your eye.
Intoxicated losers and gleeful winners seem to stream in and out of what can
only be the Casino beyond it.  The colorful, sparkling tiles that comprise
Sorcery Street seem to be shifting here - red tiles are literally rotating
around the northern archway, which is shaped like a wide-open mouth.  The
tiles on the eastern wall are also shifting, though it appears to lead
nowhere.   
 49 Brigantes Castle - The Witch's Wart - 31 rooms away                         
  Plush black carpet cushions the entirety of this lounge from wall to
wall.  Standing majestically atop a circular arrangement of ebony pedestals
are a multitude of voluptuous female statuettes.  Each is wrought in the
likeness of a female magician, and each is labelled with a certain kind of
drink.  One witch statuette tips a fizzy pink drink from her cauldron;
another witch produces a magical stream of alcohol from her wand.  A
prominent sorceress statue has been placed in the center of the room, draped
with pink ribbons and black cloth.  Similar ribbons have been used to hang
blazing jack-o-lanterns from the gothic ceiling, casting a soft glow across
the comfortable room.   
 50 Brigantes Castle - The Hallowrena - 32 rooms away                           
  Striking pillars, hewn from what appears to be etched and pitted bones,
tower ominously above the entrance to the arena.  A semi-circular counter
juts from one wall, standing out prominently.  Official-looking papers
plaster the bulletin board behind the counter, displaying the rules of the
arena.  A single roll of red carpet has been laid before the door in the far
wall.   
 51 Brigantes Castle - Vampire Alley - 32 rooms away                            
  Terminating at a blank stone wall, this alley is cramped and dank.  A
chill breeze emanates from the illusionary night above, but you are unsure
whether it is the wind or the creepiness of this alley that sends a shudder
down your spine.  A multitude of empty to overflowing trash cans have been
lined up in the back of this alley, attracting the dark red bloodflies that
buzz about.  A sewer grate has been carved into the ground here - highly
unusual for a castle that is already underground.   
 52 Brigantes Castle - Enchanted Evenings: Side Room - 32 rooms away            
  This small room looks like it may have been a closet at one point, but
has been since renovated into a work station.  A couple of benches sit
against each opposing wall, and a white slab of stone rests on the floor in
the back.  
 53 Brigantes Castle - Basil's Haberdashery - 32 rooms away                     
  This place is full of hats!  The walls are floor to ceiling packed with
shelves, each and every one crammed full of assorted hats, caps, and
chapeaus.  In the middle of the room a large worktable is piled high with
various types of cloth, felt, and other fabrics, all used for the
construction and repair of hats.  A small set of tools have been
meticulously laid out.. needle, thread, scissors, and then a host of strange
measuring and cutting implements that are more obscure in purpose.
 54 Brigantes Castle - Stairway of Judgement - 33 rooms away                    
  This is the grand staircase which connects the foyer to the south and
the throne room to the north.  The red carpet folds and flows over the
multitude of steps like a neverending serpent.  A number of larger-than-life
oil painted portraits have been hung on the walls, each face appearing to
glare condescendingly down on those who would dare to walk these stairs.  At
the very top of the extravagant stairway stand two statues - one white, one
black - each holding open one of the mahogany doors that lead to the throne
room.   
 55 Brigantes Castle - Glass Throne - 34 rooms away                             
  Glittering motes of light constantly waver about this breathtaking
throne room.  Everything is made of glass - the floors, the walls, the
chandeliers high above with an impossible number of candles, even the very
throne which resides here.  Some soft, pulsing light refracts through the
fragile material, sending iridescent shadows in all directions.  The only
non-glass accoutrement would be the single strip of carpet leading both to
the throne and out of the room.   
 56 Brigantes Castle - Vampire Alley - 34 rooms away                            
  Shadow prevails in this dank alley, swallowing everything in darkness. 
Every sound echoes ominously in this cramped, silent place.  Somewhere, a
drip of water never ceases splashing onto the moldy cobbling.  The tight
twist continues northwest, and widens into an exit to the south.   A
narrow passage runs off to the west.   
There were 1585 matches which I could not find a path to within 300 rooms.

Madra Ice Field - Filaha Camp
  This area is enclosed by the only standing wall in the ice field.  The
Filaha Order has set up their gold tents in a half-circle against it, trying
to shield themselves from the vast blizzard ravaging this area.  Shards of
ice whistle through the air, slicing down everything in its path.  The
western gate is blocked by a sparkling wall of force.

Madra Ice Field - Crystallized Forest
  Here, the sprawling ice field comes close to the outer stone wall.  It
seems a remaining circular wall still stands, enclosing the next part of the
field.  The stone doorway leading in has been blocked, however, by a
glistening wall of light.  The raging blizzard over this part of the ice
field seems to avoid the glowing barrier, which pulses to some strange beat.

Madra Ice Field - Crystallized Forest
  The icy trees crowd the path, scratching at you with sharp leaves as you
struggle to pass through the snow.  A drift in the snow leads east on a
downward slope, while there is a soft light coming from the northeast.  The
snow here is freezing and wet, and it looks as though the eastern area is
being hit with a blizzard.

Madra Ice Field - Icebound Gate
  Here is a circular, frozen gate.  The massive ice door blocks the path
further into the northwestern forest.  The sparkling trees, once sparse,
have begun to thicken and make the eastern path more narrow.  The snow falls
in a constant white blanket, keeping this section of the field frozen.  To
the southwest, there is a snow drift and a frozen lake.

  The ice continues here, hidden dangerously beneath the snow.  One false
step through soft snow could end badly.  At all times, a thick sheet of snow
falls from above, which does not bode well for anyone trying to use the lake
path.  The hill here seems to slide down beind the old gate house to the

  The trees begin to give way further ahead, their encroachment toward the west waning, though unfortunately their limelight is stolen by a creeping mountain range intent on creating an incredibly hazardous journey. The area is still enveloped in snow, cloaking the true nature of anything one might stumble upon. There is one decidedly small break through the uneven terrain, towards the northeast, while a hole that appears to have been created with dynamite is to the southeast.

  The interior of this cave in the snow sparkles like diamonds.  The walls

  This low-roofed store is full of cases displaying strange candies.  A

following you...  A filmy layer of dust covers the glass displays, leaving
grimey fingerprints around the most popular sweets.  The counter is low and
wide, much like the grim old man standing behind it.  On top of the counter,
a pink-frosted cake supports a single burning candle.   
 3  Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch - 7 rooms away                               
  Snow has fallen in two large banks here, forming a frozen ditch to pass
through.  From here you can see across the rest of the ice field.  It looks
to be nothing but a vast plain of snow encircled by an ancient and destroyed
stone wall.  The field is so deeply frozen that a wall is quite redundant
protection for the area.  To the northwest is a deep crack in the snowy
earth.  
 4  Guardia - Todo Docks - 7 rooms away                                         
  The snow that has fallen here is much thicker and colder than the rest
of the Frosty Forest.  In fact, the sloping path is so cold that footing is
frighteningly unsure.  The northeast end seems to slope more sharply down,
dropping into a sunken pass in the snow.  A large wide clear river flows
from the southeast to the northwest - a small town can be seen far west on
the other side.  There is a tiny wooden dock here.  
 5  Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 8 rooms away                             
  Lit with bat-shaped torches that flutter through the darkness, this
cobblestone pathway opens widely to the east as it approaches a busy street.
A heavy wooden door has been set in the western wall, well-cared for over
the years.  A wide window peers northern across what should be a blank stone
wall, but is instead the magically enchanted view of a forest in the night. 
A skeleton painted on the wall has been magically animated, and dances
around, clattering its bones together.   
 6  Madra Ice Field - Iceway - 8 rooms away                                     
  Here is the beginning of the iceway, a treacherous stretch of the snowy
path.  This is the trail that leads to Vahanna Lake.  The entire lake must
be frozen over which means the ice will not relent if you decide to continue
further.  Moving across the iceway in a reckless manner will cause you to
slide to the other side of the lake.  
 7  Madra Ice Field - Crystal Cave - 9 rooms away                               
  The interior of this cave in the snow sparkles like diamonds.  The walls
have frozen over into glassy blue ice.  The ground is covered with frost,
forming a smooth and frozen layer like a freshly-waxed floor.  A chute or
tunnel of some sort leads through the snow and into the eastern wall, but it
is far too slippery and steep to climb up.  
 8  Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch - 9 rooms away                               
  The ditch takes a sharp curve here.  To the west is the icy mud patch,
and to the southwest is a frozen stream.  The snow has piled so high here
that it is not possible to look out across the field any longer.  It seems
the snow has begun to freeze from the bottom, threatening to harden it into
walls.  
 9  Madra Ice Field - Frozen Stream - 10 rooms away                             
  Crossing this frozen stream will prove to be very tricky indeed. 
Although the ice looks to be solid, most adventurers know better.  Walls of
snow rise around the northeast path.  To the southwest is a sheer wall of
ice.  The frozen stream continues to the east.  
 10 Brigantes Castle - Luxurious Home - 11 rooms away                           
  Evidently, this is the gaudy home of some lavish individual, because it
has been festooned with satin drapes of all kinds.  Curtains over the
windowless walls cascade around immaculate white and pink roses, which are
growing elegantly from several curvaceous urns.  The canopy bed in the far
corner is almost collapsing under the weight of pink satin and fresh
flowers.  In fact, there are so many pillows on the bed, it's a mystery how
there is enough room for anyone to sleep in it.  A steaming tea kettle rests
on a lovely mahogany table, set amongst a set of unused china.  A pearly
door leads out onto the southern street.   
 11 Madra Ice Field - Wall of Ice - 11 rooms away                               
  The path comes to an end here at a wall of shimmering ice.  It is so
smooth and crystalline that it reflects everything here clearly.  Two arches
of white marble are built into the wall, into which has been placed a
reinforced metal door.  Strangely, the doors show no wear from the frost and
age.  Glowing silver runes are written across the wall, inviting a closer
look.  
 12 Brigantes Castle - Enchanted Evenings - 15 rooms away                       
  Gorgeous lavender curtains are hung in velvelt folds across all the
windows in this quaint shop.  The floor is of black and pink stone tiles,
and polished to a faint lustre.  Everything is perfectly organized on
shelves around the room - jars of ingredients, spell components, strange
boxes, and other magical bric-a-brac.  The room is lit by a single, pink
crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling above.  A wide circle, adorned
with astrological signs and runes, has been inked onto the floor around the
shopkeeper's chair.   
 13 Brigantes Castle - The Witch's Wart - 15 rooms away                         
  Plush black carpet cushions the entirety of this lounge from wall to
wall.  Standing majestically atop a circular arrangement of ebony pedestals
are a multitude of voluptuous female statuettes.  Each is wrought in the
likeness of a female magician, and each is labelled with a certain kind of
drink.  One witch statuette tips a fizzy pink drink from her cauldron;
another witch produces a magical stream of alcohol from her wand.  A
prominent sorceress statue has been placed in the center of the room, draped
with pink ribbons and black cloth.  Similar ribbons have been used to hang
blazing jack-o-lanterns from the gothic ceiling, casting a soft glow across
the comfortable room.   
 14 Brigantes Castle - Pumpkin Manor - 16 rooms away                            
  Remarkably average-looking compared to the bizarre and twisted look of
the rest of the city, this manor is tastefully decorated in golds and
browns.  Stained oak double doors, both fit with wide glass panes, allow
entry to a vividly flourishing garden to the west.  Above you, to the east,
is a wide balcony and a spiral staircase that majestically reaches for it. 
The finely-threaded carpet which runs in a strip across the glossy hardwood
floors ends at the northern end of the room, just short of the massive grand
staircase.

Guardia - Jagged Forest
  The trees begin to give way further ahead, their encroachment toward the west waning, though unfortunately their limelight is stolen by a creeping mountain range intent on creating an incredibly hazardous journey. The area is still enveloped in snow, cloaking the true nature of anything one might stumble upon. There is one decidedly small break through the uneven terrain, towards the northeast, while a hole that appears to have been created with dynamite is to the southeast.

  While not an entirely enclosed cave, this hole through the mountains is mostly covered with some small spots through the ceiling where some light and snow pour in.

 1  Madra Ice Field - Temple of Arctic - 22 rooms away                          
  The forest clings so tightly to the sides of the building rising ahead
that no other path can be seen.  The snowy path ends at a set of steps made
of shining, frozen ice.  At the top of the steps, a wide balcony makes up
the front of what would appear to be a large temple.  The rooftops are
carved like wicked ice spikes, and no windows mark the chilly, mighty walls.
A giant double door, bearing the symbol of a snowflake inside a circle,
stands imposingly in the base of the wall.  Thick mist seems to be rising
gently from the snow and trees, and swirling around the temple.  
There were 142 matches which I could not find a path to within 300 rooms.

Guardia - Jagged Forest
  The mountainous region lends itself as a decent shield from the snowy winds, things actually calming down hidden between various tall, rocky covers. Only but a few sparse trees continue to make their homes here, the forest to the west all but fading into obscurity. While the winds are not as harsh, the snow still falls, the cold still enveloping the area tightly in its grip. Only a single, small gap can be reasonably traversed through the mountains toward the west.

Guardia - Snow-Cloaked Mountains
  The cold winds are all but still within this nestled corner of the jagged landscape. The mountains pile up, clustered heavily in nearly all directions, dissolving any hope of further travel, save for a single cave toward the northeast. A small break is visible through the eastern mountain wall, but otherwise there is nothing but snow to see here.

 1  Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch - 3 rooms away                               
  Snow has fallen in two large banks here, forming a frozen ditch to pass
through.  From here you can see across the rest of the ice field.  It looks
to be nothing but a vast plain of snow encircled by an ancient and destroyed
stone wall.  The field is so deeply frozen that a wall is quite redundant
protection for the area.  To the northwest is a deep crack in the snowy
earth.  
 2  Brigantes Castle - Gateway of Kings - 7 rooms away                          
  At the bottom of a long and winding fight of stairs is a set of massive
double doors.  They are old and faded, but still etched with scenes
depicting great kings and large battles.  The walls are of cracked stone,
and the area before the doors is not much more than an empty well.  The
floor was once a cobbled pathway, and the cobblestones continue under the
gate. Stairs lead back up to the surface.
 3  Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 9 rooms away                             
  A glowing lantern is hung above the southwestern door, beckoning people
from the busy street into the warm lounge.  A black cat is hanging around
here, peeking at passersby from behind windows and through the cracks in
doors.  Busy people spill in the from the east, where the main gate of the
city is located, and follow the hall northwest along Voodoo Circle.   
 4  Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 10 rooms away                            
  Each step makes a clicking sound against the rough cobbling of the
uneven floor.  Deep cracks line the walls in which triangular windows have
been placed equidistantly.  Although the castle is underground, and the
windows really view a wall of dirt and stone, they have been magically
enchanted like the ceiling to peer out into a starlit night.  To the
southwest and north, Voodoo Circle continues.   
 5  Brigantes Castle - Burial Chamber - 12 rooms away                           
  The aged hieroglyphs along the walls which bear the cracks and fading
of years are immediately eye-catching.  Golden rods, from which light, thin
streams of fluttering white cotton sway, are affixed to the walls to give
the silent place a haunting flow of movement.  Various urns of a rather
large stature have been placed around the room, hand-painted and once
luxurious decor but now aging like the hieroglyphics.  In the exact center
of the tomb, a foreboding sarcophagus lies with its lid slightly ajar.   
 6  Madra Ice Field - Dragon Nest - 13 rooms away                               
  It is clear that this crystal cavern has been made into a dragon's nest. 
Large, smooth ledges in the ice make perfect lounging spots for more than
one dragon of decent size.  All of the ledges taper down to the center of
the cavern, which is a marked and cracked sheet of ice.  Under one of the
overhangs in the western wall, someone has left a burnt-out camp fire and a
thick roll of bedding.  
 7  Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade - 15 rooms away                      
  Spidering off at sharp angles, the onyx-studded street forms a junction
here.  To the west is a blazing statue hovering at the ceiling.  The heavy
door to the southeast is closed, and murky black mist seems to radiate
through the cracks.  Passing under the malevolent gaze of a row of stone
vampire statues, the widest path continues to the northeast.  A single black
crow can be seen through the dark castle windows, ever-circling the full
moon.   
 8  Brigantes Castle - Beastly Bank - 17 rooms away                             
  The most prominent architecture in the room are the metal bars behind
which the banker is protected.  They are formed like a spiderweb in front of
the counter through which citizens pass their money for safe deposit.  Real
spiders of the non-metal variety seem to have taken a liking to the
protective bars as well, spinning their own long-forgotten cobwebs among the
false gossamer.  The marble counter and floor are chipped and cracked, but
the massive stone vault in the back wall seems to be in perfect condition. 
A door with a bell attached to it leads back out onto the northern Nightmare
Promenade.   
There were 119 matches which I could not find a path to within 300 rooms.

  The air here is bone-chillingly cold. Each breath would form an impressive cloud of steam if it weren't snowing profusely. The cold, wet flakes swirl about in an angry dance. The path continues deeper into the snow, however it is also veiled by the thick snow storm hanging over it, barely concealing a breach through the eastside of the pass.

Madra Ice Field - Snowy Embankment
  A trail winds back and forth through the snow, leading to an old stone
building at the top of the embankment.  It looks to have been a gatehouse of
some kind as the remains of ancient stone walls have crumbled next to it. 
The faded crest of a gothic 'B' over a hammer and a sword can be faintly
made out over the entrance to the gatehouse.  The snow forms another, more
narrow path down the slope to the southwest.

  Running along the eastern side of the outer stone wall around the ice

large hill has formed out of snow, and something or someone has hollowed it

Madra Ice Field - Crystal Cave
  The interior of this cave in the snow sparkles like diamonds.  The walls
have frozen over into glassy blue ice.  The ground is covered with frost,

tunnel of some sort leads through the snow and into the eastern wall, but it
is far too slippery and steep to climb up.

Madra Ice Field - Before a Dark Cave
  Running along the eastern side of the outer stone wall around the ice
field, this section of the path has only two exits.  To the southwest is
more freezing snow as you move further away from the wall.  To the north a
large hill has formed out of snow, and something or someone has hollowed it
out into a cavern.

Madra Ice Field - Snow Plain
  Drifting snow has caused this section of the hill to be slippery with
loose and fresh powder.  The path ascenders to the northeast and footsteps
trudge on to the northwest.  With no trees or snowy walls to protect this
section of the field, the chill is bitter and the falling snow stings
against bare skin.

Madra Ice Field - Snowy Embankment
  A trail winds back and forth through the snow, leading to an old stone
building at the top of the embankment.  It looks to have been a gatehouse of
some kind as the remains of ancient stone walls have crumbled next to it. 
The faded crest of a gothic 'B' over a hammer and a sword can be faintly
made out over the entrance to the gatehouse.  The snow forms another, more
narrow path down the slope to the southwest.

Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch
  Snow has fallen in two large banks here, forming a frozen ditch to pass
through.  From here you can see across the rest of the ice field.  It looks
to be nothing but a vast plain of snow encircled by an ancient and destroyed
stone wall.  The field is so deeply frozen that a wall is quite redundant
protection for the area.  To the northwest is a deep crack in the snowy
earth.

  At this point in the ditch, a tree has rolled down the embankment and
ripped open a vast patch of frozen mud.  Even worse, the snow has since
renewed itself, and the mud is now not only frozen but slushy as well. 
Animal tracks dot the mud and the nearby snow, and may warrant a closer

  The path comes to an end here at a wall of shimmering ice.  It is so
smooth and crystalline that it reflects everything here clearly.  Two arches

reinforced metal door.  Strangely, the doors show no wear from the frost and

Madra Ice Field - Beyond the Wall
  There is no door on this side of the ice wall like there is on the other
side.  It is clearly magical in nature and almost spiteful.  The chill in
the air here has a bite to it and the path is still enclosed by high-packed
snow.  From the shimmering wall, a path through the snow leads uphill to the

  The path in the snow winds left to right, trailing up the gentle slope to

  As the river curves around the banks of fluffy snow, the surface abruptly
falls away.  Snow has fallen on the rest of the river, completely blocking

snowbank, but it's much too steep to climb from the river.  Another snowbank
has formed, hugging the east side of the river.  It looks packed down and
provides a safer route than the slippery river, but like the western bank,
is unreachable from here.  The river twists around a bend to the southeast.

Madra Ice Field - High Snowbank
  From the top of this snow drift, the frozen river is visible to the west,
and a vast plain of snow to the east.  A path looks to have been made
through the snowy terrain although it is more than shoulder high.  This

Madra Ice Field - Impasse
  A tree has fallen across the path here, blocking the snow drift as well
as the river below.  It's no wonder the tree fell as the snow here has
thinned out and is quite fresh.  The snow bank is shallow enough to slide
down to the river below, but climbing back up would be impossible.  There
seems to be something sticking up out of the snow several feet away from the
end of the ledge.

Madra Ice Field - Frozen Descent
  A small area of the snow has been compacted into a short slope, ideal for
sledding or climbing between the flat field and the path above.  The snow
below is powdery and thin, engulfing travelers up to their hips and making
it difficult to travel on foot.  To the west, the ice field stretches vastly
until it meets the perimeter wall.  To the south is a stretch of the frozen
river, and to the southeast is a snow bank that safely passes it.

-------------------------------------------------------
 1  Madra Ice Field - Fishing Hole - 2 rooms away                               
  As the river curves around the banks of fluffy snow, the surface abruptly
falls away.  Snow has fallen on the rest of the river, completely blocking
any advancement from the surface of the water.  Taking up almost all of this
dead end is a large fishing hole that has been cracked and shattered into
the frozen layer of the icy water.  
 2  Madra Ice Field - Frozen River - 3 rooms away                               
  The main section of the river flows through this place, but is eternally
topfrozen from the temperature.  Not a single crack marrs the smooth, icy
surface.  A hole in the outer wall can be seen just over the western
snowbank, but it's much too steep to climb from the river.  Another snowbank
has formed, hugging the east side of the river.  It looks packed down and
provides a safer route than the slippery river, but like the western bank,
is unreachable from here.  The river twists around a bend to the southeast. 
 3  Madra Ice Field - Frozen Ditch - 7 rooms away                               
  Snow has fallen in two large banks here, forming a frozen ditch to pass
through.  From here you can see across the rest of the ice field.  It looks
to be nothing but a vast plain of snow encircled by an ancient and destroyed
stone wall.  The field is so deeply frozen that a wall is quite redundant
protection for the area.  To the northwest is a deep crack in the snowy
earth.  
 4  Brigantes Castle - Gateway of Kings - 17 rooms away                         
  At the bottom of a long and winding fight of stairs is a set of massive
double doors.  They are old and faded, but still etched with scenes
depicting great kings and large battles.  The walls are of cracked stone,
and the area before the doors is not much more than an empty well.  The
floor was once a cobbled pathway, and the cobblestones continue under the
gate. Stairs lead back up to the surface.
 5  Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 19 rooms away                            
  A glowing lantern is hung above the southwestern door, beckoning people
from the busy street into the warm lounge.  A black cat is hanging around
here, peeking at passersby from behind windows and through the cracks in
doors.  Busy people spill in the from the east, where the main gate of the
city is located, and follow the hall northwest along Voodoo Circle.   
 6  Madra Ice Field - Dragon Nest - 19 rooms away                               
  It is clear that this crystal cavern has been made into a dragon's nest. 
Large, smooth ledges in the ice make perfect lounging spots for more than
one dragon of decent size.  All of the ledges taper down to the center of
the cavern, which is a marked and cracked sheet of ice.  Under one of the
overhangs in the western wall, someone has left a burnt-out camp fire and a
thick roll of bedding.  
 7  Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle - 20 rooms away                            
  Each step makes a clicking sound against the rough cobbling of the
uneven floor.  Deep cracks line the walls in which triangular windows have
been placed equidistantly.  Although the castle is underground, and the
windows really view a wall of dirt and stone, they have been magically
enchanted like the ceiling to peer out into a starlit night.  To the
southwest and north, Voodoo Circle continues.   
 8  Brigantes Castle - Burial Chamber - 22 rooms away                           
  The aged hieroglyphs along the walls which bear the cracks and fading
of years are immediately eye-catching.  Golden rods, from which light, thin
streams of fluttering white cotton sway, are affixed to the walls to give
the silent place a haunting flow of movement.  Various urns of a rather
large stature have been placed around the room, hand-painted and once
luxurious decor but now aging like the hieroglyphics.  In the exact center
of the tomb, a foreboding sarcophagus lies with its lid slightly ajar.   
 9  Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade - 25 rooms away                      
  Spidering off at sharp angles, the onyx-studded street forms a junction
here.  To the west is a blazing statue hovering at the ceiling.  The heavy
door to the southeast is closed, and murky black mist seems to radiate
through the cracks.  Passing under the malevolent gaze of a row of stone
vampire statues, the widest path continues to the northeast.  A single black
crow can be seen through the dark castle windows, ever-circling the full
moon.   
 10 Brigantes Castle - Beastly Bank - 27 rooms away                             
  The most prominent architecture in the room are the metal bars behind
which the banker is protected.  They are formed like a spiderweb in front of
the counter through which citizens pass their money for safe deposit.  Real
spiders of the non-metal variety seem to have taken a liking to the
protective bars as well, spinning their own long-forgotten cobwebs among the
false gossamer.  The marble counter and floor are chipped and cracked, but
the massive stone vault in the back wall seems to be in perfect condition. 
A door with a bell attached to it leads back out onto the northern Nightmare
Promenade.   
There were 117 matches which I could not find a path to within 300 rooms.

Madra Ice Field - Diamond Ravine
  Small sparkling lights dance across the snow around this place like
hundreds of diamonds.  A deep ditch to the south curves around one of the
towering frozen walls, completely smooth and apparently untouched by anyone
or anything passing through.  Yet another break in the path continues to the
east, where the chilly and frosty pathway digs deeper into the labyrinthine
field.

Madra Ice Field - Nearing an Excavation
  The sparkling snow of the Diamond Ravine continues along these frozen
corridors, but the pathway is no longer made of snow; a mirror-like sheet of
ice lines the trail.  Discarded ice picks and an overturned mining cart are
laying here, with the bones of some ancient creature.  A path splits off to
the north, and another to the east from which yelling and noise can be
heard.  The Diamond Ravine is to the west.

  A tunnel has been dug into the ice field, forming a kind of frozen mine

other short passages beginning to branch off as they are dug deeper into the
ice.  The signs of work are all around as picks and overturned carts for
removing excavated ice lay randomly about.

Madra Ice Field - Nearing an Excavation
  The sparkling snow of the Diamond Ravine continues along these frozen
corridors, but the pathway is no longer made of snow; a mirror-like sheet of
ice lines the trail.  Discarded ice picks and an overturned mining cart are
laying here, with the bones of some ancient creature.  A path splits off to
the north, and another to the east from which yelling and noise can be

  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

This tiny three-dimensional triangle can hold a massive expanse of
magical power, and does so by siphoning it from other items.  You can trade
this object to a willing Immortal in order to have all extra magical
effects removed from a piece of equipment, which are then stored in this
prism and may be placed on another piece of equipment at a later time.  Note
that this only holds extra augmented effects that are not inherently part
of the original item, and things like extra weapon flags will not transfer
to a piece of armor.  
 
Any restrictive flags that are applied to an item along with an augment (such
as the Mage's Insight one-per-weapon restriction) will carry over along with
the augments themselves.  Hence, one could not use multiple Augment Storages
and multiple Mage's Inight objects to merge into a single weapon!

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.
(] Exits: north south [)
     A pale bluish-green roll of parchment sits on the floor.
     A psychedelic-patterend truffle with a magic glow sits here.
     A rolled-up bit of parchment is here, sporting an armor seal.
     (37) A packed ball of snow is lying here, waiting to be tossed.
     A large statue of a snake spills a limitless amount of nourishing liquid from its mouth.

Artificial Principality, Pioneer 2 - South Boulevard
  A long stretch of boulevard extends from a southern set of wide metal
doors all the way to the north, the end of which can't be seen from here. 
The station is one of mechanical wonder, with bright lights and neon signs
hoisted where they need to be, and a glowing touchpad is noticeable against
the aforementioned southern doors.  Biological inclusions are visible,
however, such as the normal-looking potted plant sitting on the ground
nearby.  Both nearby and in the distance, people of various genetic makeups
are seen moving about and chatting with each other, making the place seem
almost city-like.

Pioneer 2 - Boulevard
  The street branches off on a very short path toward the west from here,
leading to a large, square-cut open door of a building.  Set atop this
doorway is a brightly-lit neon sign, advertising itself in an odd futuristic
font.  The path ahead looks to gradually become reddish in color as the glow
of a transportational device, set off to one side, bathes a wide area around
it in its own pulsing light.

Pioneer 2 - Rest Area
  A set of steel benches are set off to one side of the road, centered
around a small metallic fountain fashioned from some old-world historic
design, quietly bubbling a clean stream of water.  A raised stone platform
sits on either side of the benches, each centered with a mound of soil and
growing grass therefrom.  Soft red light blooms from the glare of a
teleportation pad just to the east, and a very large building can be seen a
decent ways to the north of here.

     A set of steel benches are aligned around the area, offering multiple seats.

Pioneer 2 - North Boulevard
  Coming closer into view, a looming building can now be seen as two
"detached" buildings that are separated only by a high-raised catwalk that
appears to go from roof to roof, and a subtle alleyway leads around to the
side.  The structure spanning a large portion of the northwest end bears a
massive neon sign that shimmers from color to color in an endless cycle,
while the northern, somewhat-smaller building has no such sign, and only
seems to have a wide counter stretching across its front.  The road extends
north and south from here.

Pioneer 2 - Congregation Plaza
  Sliding doors here provide an entrance to a somewhat-extravagant
building, brightly-lit in all aspects where the glow of neon and
phosphorescent lighting don't already dominate.  The immediate vicinity
expands out into a cul-de-sac section, with a number of smaller and darker
buildings set into the backdrop, away from the general public.  A smaller,
but still fairly large, building is set into the north end of this
artificial city, and further down the strip, a domed building can be seen.

Pioneer 2 - Congregation Plaza
  This open section of the orbital space colony seems to be left as a
gathering place for large groups of people; large clay pots line the edge of
the paved walkway that goes around the cul-de-sac and its intersecting
southwest-to-northeast path, some of them sporting simple everyday plants,
and others shooting out tall (but still fake) palm trees high into the air. 
A series of benches sit between two of these plants, sleek and metallic in
design.  A round, close-doored chamber stands at the edge of the area, with
a backlit touchpad visible on either side of the door.

Pioneer 2 - R&D Lab Transporation Pod
  The inside of this teleporation chamber is a bit on the claustrophobic
side, bearing little more for space than could accommodate two people at
most.  Wide rings of red light, a seemingly common feature of these devices,
revolve around the inside edges of the walls, casting its glaring light all
around as it passes.  A white-backlit touchpad is visible near the entrance
doorway, and above it, a metal plate indicating the destination of this
device.

Pioneer 2 - Station Transporation Pod
  The room's architecture is oddly spherical, creating wider rings of red
light as they continually encircle the interior walls.  Various bits of
circuitry are visible in the walls, some glowing, some inert, but nothing
that looks overly dangerous.  A backlit touchpad is seen right next to the
metal doors leading out of this chamber, and a mat made of strange material
is on the ground in front of the door, looking worn to hell and back.

Pioneer 2 - Research and Development Lab: Lobby Office
  A small room, almost office-like in design, is set in the middle of an
intersection of other rooms leading in all cardinal directions, only the
eastern of which is securely closed with a thick bar and latch.  A
cubicle-like workstation is set away at the back end of the room, where a
computer is busy buzzing away with information.  Various sounds can be heard
from pretty much all of the adjoining rooms, ranging from creature-made
noises to heavy machinery being worked on, to the humming of a transporter.

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.

Onrac - Village Cemetary
  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.

  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a
northern church, the western entrance of the village proper, and the general
rest of the village to the south.  Cries of seagulls punctuate the
west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

  A sandy cobblestone path sashays toward the harbor under the shade of two

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet
chatter from ten feet below.

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.

Onrac - Village Cemetary
  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.

Onrac - Crossroads
  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a
northern church, the western entrance of the village proper, and the general
rest of the village to the south.  Cries of seagulls punctuate the
west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear
blue sky.

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
     A Christmas tree stands here, adorned with holiday decorations.

Truce - East of Fountain
  A sandy cobblestone path sashays toward the harbor under the shade of two
rows of poplar trees.  A salty breeze gusts down the path, tossing up swirls
of fluttering leaves.  East, a pier extends over the sea.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.  
(] Exits: north east west down [)
     A black warp pipe is sticking out of the pier.

Truce - Pier
  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet
chatter from ten feet below.  
(] Exits: east west [)
[AFK] Uploading Carsanquay... (97%) is here.

Truce - Pier
  The pier turns a corner here, offering an unobstructed view of the
endless waves lazily rolling across the Western Sea.  In the opposite
direction, the homes and shops of Truce stand all abreast along the
coastline.  A fixed telescope is bolted into the corner of the pier,
pointing northeast.

Truce - Pier
  A large docking station marks the end of the pier.  Several docking
cleats and bollards line the eastern edge, in various stages of rust from
the endless waves and mist.  A single streetlamp stands at the terminus of
the pier, brimming over a few benches for those anticipating the return of a
familiar face.

The S.S. Zelbess is currently docked at the pier.

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

This particularly boring coin is, in fact, exceptionally valuable; you
can trade it to Lilly or another Immortal in order to clone an item
currently in your possession.  The cloned item will be a 100% replication of
the object it was derived from, right down to special traits, descriptions,
and even applied enchantments.  Restrictions and prohibitions will apply
based on the item in question, and include (but are not limited to)
Immortal-Shop items, Unique-flagged items, and this item itself. 
Additionally, a single, individual item may only be cloned a maximum of
three times, and then it will no longer be eligible for further
duplication.

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.
(] Exits: north south [)
     A pale bluish-green roll of parchment sits on the floor.
     A psychedelic-patterend truffle with a magic glow sits here.
     A rolled-up bit of parchment is here, sporting an armor seal.
     (37) A packed ball of snow is lying here, waiting to be tossed.
     A large statue of a snake spills a limitless amount of nourishing liquid from its mouth.
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,

even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

[Player Housing] A soot-blackened shop in the Demon's abyss
  The outside of the store is black, with magma flowing to the left
of it. Soot rains from the black sky, and the floor is covered with
ashes. The inside of the store is dark, and the walls seem to be
closing in on you. Everything is cluttered. Many ancient and demonic
artifacts are displayed tightly together on the shelves lining the walls,
and within the bookcases on the floor. There isn't a bare spot anywhere,
even the ceilings are covered with artifacts. There are ancient demon
pictures painted on the ceiling along with statues of old demon gods
hanging from the walls. You swear you can see the statues follow you as
you turn from their terrifying gaze.

A beautiful and charismatic red-skinned humanoid with horns and glowing
red eyes towers over you at a staggering 13 feet tall.  His beard is
perfectly trimmed, and his smile is overwhelming with confidence.  He is
adorned with expensive black and red clothes, of which are said to be
valuable enough to cover the annual spending of any nation.  In one hand you
see a Ruby Rod of Asmodeus, proof that this is one of the avatars of
Asmodeus.  Underneath the expensive garments, his body is wracked with
bleeding injuries, but he seems completely unconcerned with the pain the
injuries have caused him.

A beautiful and charismatic red-skinned humanoid with horns and glowing
red eyes towers over you at a staggering 13 feet tall.  His beard is
perfectly trimmed, and his smile is overwhelming with confidence.  He is
adorned with expensive black and red clothes, of which are said to be
valuable enough to cover the annual spending of any nation.  In one hand you
see a Ruby Rod of Asmodeus, proof that this is one of the avatars of
Asmodeus.  Underneath the expensive garments, his body is wracked with
bleeding injuries, but he seems completely unconcerned with the pain the
injuries have caused him.

You get an Emblem of Recycling from a beautiful crystalline backpack, tailored with feyan silk.

This beautiful gemstone appears to be some side of odd fusion of topaz,
ruby, and emerald, all thrown together to create an intriguing piece of
jewelry.  What's more intriguing than THAT, however, is what this object can
do for you!  If you find five copies of a single piece of equipment, you
may exchange them and this gemstone to Lilly, and she will remove ONE (1)
effect from the equipment and transfer it onto a different piece of
equipment.  All five copies of the original equipment WILL BE DESTROYED
in the process, however, so think carefully when deciding!  
 
Effects include, but are not limited to: Stat bonuses (Str, HP, Mana, etc.),
Weapon effects (everything except Vorpal or Sharp), and 'Extra Effects' (float,
regen, etc. - any except haste).
 
The level of equipment to be transferred cannot be more than 20 levels
under the level of the item being transferred to. Additionally, a single
item may only be augmented once in this way; any other uses of Recycling
Emblems must be used on a different item, and a single character may only
ever apply a total of 3 Emblem-Recycled augments across all their items.

If you're not sure, ask Lilly for clarification and certification!

This excellent coin can be used not only to restring an item's aesthetic
appearance, but also its entire phsyical makeup!  By trading this to an
Immortal, you may have an item redescribed and reassigned to a separate
wearable location (barring shoulders, waist and arms).  All stats and item
effects will remain the same - armor class, however, may be lowered slightly
in accordance with the new location (obviously, you're not going to get away
with having -80 AC on a ring slot), if applicable.

This rare substance has the power to meld together two different items
into one, maintaining (most of) their properties and taking on a shape that
resembles one, the other, or both.  
 
You may exchange this item to Lilly in order to fuse together two different
items, effectively combining their stats into a single object.  The
following rules apply for the fusion process, and are subject to Lilly's
overarching discretion on a case-by-case basis:
 
A (Lesser) Bonding Core allows fusion of items up to level 30.
A (Greater) Bonding Core allows fusion of items up to level 50.
An (Ultimate) Bonding Core allows fusion of items up to level 100.
 
-Unique items cannot be fused with anything else in any capacity. Use of a
Normifier Signet does not alter this restriction.
-HP/Mana/Moves may not exceed 400, and Damroll/Magroll may not exceed 10,
when fusing together items with multiple values of the above.
-Items cloned using a Token of Limited Cloning cannot be fused with the item
it was cloned from, nor can it be fused with a cloned item from anything else.
-Items created by this fusion process cannot be fused again with any other
item.
-Fused objects will take on the higher of the item levels between the two.
-Weapons will take on the higher average damage between the two being fused.
-You can only bond two items of the same wearslot.
-Delevelers do not count toward the actual level of the item being bonded.
 
More restrictions may apply, and again, are left to Lilly's discretion.

Neat inventions occasionally come in strange designs, and this
contraption is no exception.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really do much by
itself other than look neat.  You CAN, however, exchange it to Lilly in
order to have one detrimental stat removed from anything you own.  This
includes negative HP, mana, damroll, etc.  This does not apply to effects
such as elemental vulnerabilities or cursed effects like haunt.  
 
Note: There are maximum amounts which may be removed from particularly-
detrimental equipment: Damroll & Magroll can be improved by 5 each; HP,
Mana and Moves can be improved by 300 each; Saves can be reduced by 10; Core
Stats can be improved by 3 each; AC can be reduced by 10.

Mio Akiyama says 'Okay, taking you to Pioneer 2!'

Artificial Principality, Pioneer 2 - South Boulevard
  A long stretch of boulevard extends from a southern set of wide metal
doors all the way to the north, the end of which can't be seen from here. 
The station is one of mechanical wonder, with bright lights and neon signs
hoisted where they need to be, and a glowing touchpad is noticeable against
the aforementioned southern doors.  Biological inclusions are visible,
however, such as the normal-looking potted plant sitting on the ground
nearby.  Both nearby and in the distance, people of various genetic makeups
are seen moving about and chatting with each other, making the place seem
almost city-like.

(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

Pioneer 2 - Boulevard
  The street branches off on a very short path toward the west from here,
leading to a large, square-cut open door of a building.  Set atop this
doorway is a brightly-lit neon sign, advertising itself in an odd futuristic
font.  The path ahead looks to gradually become reddish in color as the glow
of a transportational device, set off to one side, bathes a wide area around
it in its own pulsing light.

Pioneer 2 - Rest Area
  A set of steel benches are set off to one side of the road, centered
around a small metallic fountain fashioned from some old-world historic
design, quietly bubbling a clean stream of water.  A raised stone platform
sits on either side of the benches, each centered with a mound of soil and
growing grass therefrom.  Soft red light blooms from the glare of a
teleportation pad just to the east, and a very large building can be seen a
decent ways to the north of here.

     A set of steel benches are aligned around the area, offering multiple seats.

Pioneer 2 - North Boulevard
  Coming closer into view, a looming building can now be seen as two
"detached" buildings that are separated only by a high-raised catwalk that
appears to go from roof to roof, and a subtle alleyway leads around to the
side.  The structure spanning a large portion of the northwest end bears a
massive neon sign that shimmers from color to color in an endless cycle,
while the northern, somewhat-smaller building has no such sign, and only
seems to have a wide counter stretching across its front.  The road extends
north and south from here.

Pioneer 2 - Congregation Plaza
  Sliding doors here provide an entrance to a somewhat-extravagant
building, brightly-lit in all aspects where the glow of neon and
phosphorescent lighting don't already dominate.  The immediate vicinity
expands out into a cul-de-sac section, with a number of smaller and darker
buildings set into the backdrop, away from the general public.  A smaller,
but still fairly large, building is set into the north end of this
artificial city, and further down the strip, a domed building can be seen.

Pioneer 2 - Congregation Plaza
  This open section of the orbital space colony seems to be left as a
gathering place for large groups of people; large clay pots line the edge of
the paved walkway that goes around the cul-de-sac and its intersecting
southwest-to-northeast path, some of them sporting simple everyday plants,
and others shooting out tall (but still fake) palm trees high into the air. 
A series of benches sit between two of these plants, sleek and metallic in
design.  A round, close-doored chamber stands at the edge of the area, with
a backlit touchpad visible on either side of the door.

Pioneer 2 - R&D Lab Transporation Pod
  The inside of this teleporation chamber is a bit on the claustrophobic
side, bearing little more for space than could accommodate two people at
most.  Wide rings of red light, a seemingly common feature of these devices,
revolve around the inside edges of the walls, casting its glaring light all
around as it passes.  A white-backlit touchpad is visible near the entrance
doorway, and above it, a metal plate indicating the destination of this
device.

A column of blinding white light shoots up suddenly from the ground, dematerializing those currently in the pod and transferring them somewhere else!

Pioneer 2 - Station Transporation Pod
  The room's architecture is oddly spherical, creating wider rings of red
light as they continually encircle the interior walls.  Various bits of
circuitry are visible in the walls, some glowing, some inert, but nothing
that looks overly dangerous.  A backlit touchpad is seen right next to the
metal doors leading out of this chamber, and a mat made of strange material
is on the ground in front of the door, looking worn to hell and back.

Pioneer 2 - Research and Development Lab: Lobby Office
  A small room, almost office-like in design, is set in the middle of an
intersection of other rooms leading in all cardinal directions, only the
eastern of which is securely closed with a thick bar and latch.  A
cubicle-like workstation is set away at the back end of the room, where a
computer is busy buzzing away with information.  Various sounds can be heard
from pretty much all of the adjoining rooms, ranging from creature-made
noises to heavy machinery being worked on, to the humming of a transporter.

Pioneer 2 - Research and Development Lab: Walkway
  The sound of churning machinery takes over your hearing as you enter this
room, not overly loud but very boisterous.  A railing-guarded walkway leads
around from south to east, and far below can be seen gears, wiring, and
other technical mechanics, stretching down into the abyss.  A metal-plated
sign is welded into the wall above the eastern doorway, looking fairly new
compared to the rest of the room.  
(] Exits: east south [)
A scientist of Pioneer 2 is here, researching and/or developing.

Pioneer 2 - Research and Development Lab: Unkept Laboratory
  This room is a mess.  Crates and boxes of stuff are piled high in the
various corners, papers and documents sticking out of their openings on all
sides.  Assorted maps and charts are hung on the walls pretty much wherever
an open spot happens to be, and unfurled schematics and blueprints are
sitting on the ground along these walls, apparently waiting to be placed at
a moment's notice.  A wide bin sits nearby, jammed full of crunched-up and
unwanted papers.

A Pioneer 2 R&D overseer says 'Ah, there you are.  It didn't take us anywhere near as long to determine the monuments' focal point as the Princpal had anticipated.  Some of us are just good at what we do.'
Phillia Felice pretends to keep looking through her own documents, but a smirk is briefly evident.
A Pioneer 2 R&D overseer says 'That aside, I hope you're ready for your next task.  It appears that you'll be going somewhere not of this planet; indeed, our tracers have locked onto a signal that appears to be coming from a nearby orbiting moon.'
A Pioneer 2 R&D overseer says 'We've set up a transporter for travel between here and a cavern we've staked out at a safe location upon the moon's surface.  We've sent a few parties ahead of you already, and they can fill you in on details once you've arrived.'
A Pioneer 2 R&D overseer says 'Take this key and use the transporter in the room beyond.  Be wary of anything you might encounter, the moon is a new frontier that we are not at all familiar with.'

[Notes - Pioneer 2 - Research and Development Lab: Lunar Transport Pod - push button]
You push a large black button.  Effective?
A large black button closes the door.
A loud hum fills the chamber as the transporter comes to life!
The hum quickly escalates into a roar as a vivid golden light fills the room, blinding your eyesight as you feel yourself whisked away from the station and hurled into space!

Unknown Area - Cave
   This small cave seems to have been naturally made over time, given the
roughness and inconsistency of the white, dusty walls and ceiling.  The air
feels very thin here, as though oxygen were in short supply.  A low corridor
offers one direction out of here, as there is little to see and even less to
do at the present location.

Unknown Area - Separator Partition
   A large shimmering door stands here against the mouth of the cave,
crafted from some crystalline material that isn't glass but isn't jewelled
mineral, either.  Translucent to a degree, one can finally determine their
location by looking beyond it, outside; the vast reaches of outer space are
presented to the viewer, high and above the rocky surface of a barren planet
that stretches out in all visible directions.  On the other side of the
door, a domed passageway leads in airtight confinement toward a huge crystal
tower, the only actual structure that can be seen as far as the eye can
witness.

Lunar Surface - Airlock
  A wide, multifaceted tube provides a safe, oxygen-filled path from the
southern cave to a large crystal tower at the north end.  Being
significantly transparent, one can make out the desolate surface of the
rocky, battered landscape outside, complete with what appear to be floating
amoeba-like objects gliding through the airless atmosphere, colored in
shades of varying reds and blues.

Lunar Surface - Airlock
  Towering high into the upper levels of space, the crystal structure in
front of this airlock is traversely impeded by an opaque white seal embedded
on a door-like frame, upon which can be seen three colorful insignias
equidistantly-set apart from one another.  The solidness of the 'door'
disallows any visibility beyond.

You lean over with your arm extended and touch the sealed insignias with your hand. 

The colorful symbols react to your touch with great effect, rapidly becoming very intense lights upon the door!
A short-range teleport spell suddenly overtakes you, bringing you beyond the sealed door and into the Lunar Palace!

Lunar Palace - Great Hall
  Built like a transparent crystal castle, the interior of this
establishment gleams and glimmers from all angles, including the sleek and
glassy floor through which the hard lunar surface can be seen underneath. 
Two hallways lead away to separate wings of the palace, and a throne-seated
dais can be seen further in.  Behind, the doorframe of an airlock tunnel
bears a collective insignia upon its surface.  
(] Exits: north east [south] west [)

Lunar Palace - Throne Room
  Short crystal pedestals encircle and line a raised dais where a worn
golden throne rests, empty.  A rug of embroidered red and yellow sits upon
its base underneath, but is significantly frayed around the edges.  Thin
silver chains hang from supports overhead, secured to orbs of bright yellow
luminance that provide light to the entire room.  Far in the back, a wide
but brief hallway can be seen leading to the opposite end of the palace.

  Tiled crystal flooring leads back into a small connective chamber-like
hallway that ends at a large set of double-doors made of iron.  Like the
rest of the palace, the material that composes these tiles seems to generate
its own light, glowing softly from within and reflecting its own
illumination to amplify its effect.  A side room is almost overlooked here
on the west wall of the corridor.

Lunar Palace - Crystal Room South
  Two enormous well-like pits lay out in front of you at the southern end
of this expansive room, both housing a gleaming, glittering crystal
structure that levitates serenely in the air, shedding a silent and
potentially ominous light.  Structures like these appear to encircle the
entirety of the room along its exterior, surrounding a large clear pad that
stands alone in the center of them all.  The layout of the room is
symmetrical in all four cardinal variants, though the crystal material that
comprises its housing seems somewhat darker, casting a dimmer light over the
area than its connective southern rooms beyond the door.

  This bare room made of crystal is decorated only by a large, raised white
circle pad at the far end, gussied up with a small assortment of attachments
and electronics.  An obnoxious hum resounds throughout the entire room, and
a low-ceiling door leads out into a much larger one, eastward.

Lunar Subterrane - B7 - "Save Point"
  An attention-grabbing pink circle is laid out in the center of this room,
encompassing much of the floor space along with it, centered with a raised
alphanumeric symbol coated in white.  A ring of black metal torch-stands,
all lit and flickering wildly, and doing a modest job of keeping it (not to
mention the rest of the small room) very well-lit.  A few stubby stalactites
are hanging from the ceiling overhead, but why would you pay attention to
those?  There's a giant letter 'S' right here!

  A simple iron door fits within a hollowed recess of the north wall,
fitted with an iron rung on each side for ease of pulling open.  The
continued smell of something mechanical grows stronger the further east this
corridor leads, though the terrible chill in the area also seems to
gradually be diminishing.

  An ornate door is built into the north wall here, fashioned from some

  A dome-shaped pairing of sandstone doors are aligned within their slot
against the wall here, coloration and design significantly out of place
among the dry lunar rock.  Patterns are carved upon its surface, perhaps
indicating the room beyond's usage.  The long hallway appears to be coming
upon a diversion at a short distance ahead, bending in a right-angle
northward just to the east.

  The floor begins to ascend here, leading both up and north alongside the
series of rooms that lay within the northwest wall front.  Heat becomes more
prevalent here, almost going toe-to-toe with the general cold factor of
being on a lunar surface.  If this was a normal atmosphere, you might almost
have to worry about a storm system kicking in as a result!

Lunar Subterrane - B7
  A dome-shaped pairing of sandstone doors are aligned within their slot
against the wall here, coloration and design significantly out of place
among the dry lunar rock.  Patterns are carved upon its surface, perhaps
indicating the room beyond's usage.  The long hallway appears to be coming
upon a diversion at a short distance ahead, bending in a right-angle
northward just to the east.

Lunar Subterrane - B7 - Shrine
  The walls of this room, though still composed of the same white rock as
the rest of this region, have been carved into dozens upon dozens of large,
draconic shapes, most of which are skeletal in appearance.  Two tall
candlebras are positioned in the center of the room, brightly illuminating a
beautiful, ruby-decorated treasure chest that sits on the floor between
them.
(] Exits: south [)
     A beautiful golden chest is here, slightly dusty.
A ball of wavering white fire is floating in the air here.

You slip into a trance.
The Lunasaur briefly falls into a clattering pile of reptilian skeleton pieces, but swiftly reassembles itself along with its sidelong cohort, once more looming over the area.
The Lunasaur says 'There is no denying your spirit or commitment to your fight, though whether it is foreshadowed over the desire for power yet remains to be seen.'
The Lunasaur says 'Whatever your intent, we will fulfill our promise to you.  Take now this treasure of the Lunarians, but be mindful of its owner; once taken, it is theirs to keep indefinitely.'
A mysterious force unlocks a golden, ruby-encrusted treasure chest.

Lunar Subterrane - B7
  A dome-shaped pairing of sandstone doors are aligned within their slot
against the wall here, coloration and design significantly out of place
among the dry lunar rock.  Patterns are carved upon its surface, perhaps
indicating the room beyond's usage.  The long hallway appears to be coming
upon a diversion at a short distance ahead, bending in a right-angle
northward just to the east.

  The floor begins to ascend here, leading both up and north alongside the

have to worry about a storm system kicking in as a result!

Lunar Subterrane - B7
  A grody but somehow still-sturdy iron ladder rises from the ground to an
upper ledge here, coated in rust.  Under that ledge, the shadowy north wall
is home a huge set of metal doors, tightly closed and set with a pair of
equally-large metal hoops for handles.  It feels very warm here; the heat
that has been building since the entrance to this cave is likely coming from
somewhere nearby.  
(] Exits: north up [)
A cloud of noxious vapor lingers in the air.
A brilliant red dragon flies through here, encased in a wave of its own heat.
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

Lunar Subterrane - B7
  In sharp contrast to every cave explored on the moon thus far, a
pearlescent finish is smoothed over the surfaces of this room, creating a
glossy frame amidst the still-bumpy exterior of wall, ceiling and floor. 
Humid warmth flows into the area from downstairs, which a narrow set of
stone steps gradually descends into, and with that heat comes a source of
light, removing all trace of darkness exemplified by being this far under
the lunar surface.  A pair of large metal doors is lined up against the
south wall, but unfortunately does not appear to possess a handle or
keyhole.

Lunar Core - First Layer
  A fragmented display of glassy road meets your eyes as you step foot
into the deepest recesses of the moon's interior, where a welcome heat
pervades the atmosphere and, strangely, natural oxygen seems to be in
abundance.  Unstable yet sleek, a polished walkway, made up of
asymmetrical crystal shards all hewn together, provides a path through the
area, which appears to descend even further below.  Polished stairs
ascend back toward the upper levels of the subterrane.

Lunar Core - First Layer
  This lowhand road is lined by a narrow trench within a recess of the
north wall, following along before an abrupt stop as a sharp slant in one of
the glass plates drops off below to a platform further down.  Many lines of
a brown-tinged liquid are seen filtering in from the underside of the ledge
above you, dribbling down the side of the wall and collecting into the
makeshift reservoir.

against the opaque black abyss of the core's backdrop.

Lunar Core - Second Layer
  Distorted light filters in through the semi-transparent diamond walls of
this hallway, allowing enough illumination to maintain comfortable
visibility without obnoxious reflection.  The ground surface is a little on
the slippery side, being made of one smooth layer, as opposed to the
fragmented pieces encountered in the previous region.  
(] Exits: east west [)
(Charmed) [Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard have been sent here to do their master's bidding.

  Projections of diamond jut out of the side of the wall here as the
corridor reaches its west end, trailing down the side and providing hand and
foot holds for descaling to a lower portion down below.  The ceiling arcs
downward accordingly, encasing a new hallway in the same sheet of beautiful
diamond cover.  
(] Exits: east down [)
     (Humming) A small slab of white rock is here, engraved with ancient writing.
     A thin glass bottle sits here, labeled with a trio of cyan crosses in front.

  Claustrophobes need not venture further along this diamondine pass, as
the ceiling gradually drops until it is a foot or so above an average
human's top height.  A thin wall section enables brighter light to shine into
the area from the outside, creating stripes of gold across the thicker walls'
surfaces.  Mineral stumps protrude from the wall and scale upward here,
leading to a higher locale.

  Claustrophobes need not venture further along this diamondine pass, as
the ceiling gradually drops until it is a foot or so above an average
human's top height.  A thin wall section enables brighter light to shine into
the area from the outside, creating stripes of gold across the thicker walls'
surfaces.  Mineral stumps protrude from the wall and scale upward here,
leading to a higher locale.

  A large stone effigy intrudes upon the otherwise-flawless run of diamond
encasement within this corridor, melded within the north wallface and shaped
not unlike a large and bulky person.  The glittering of a few gemstones can
been seen upon it in key locations.  Elsewise, this is the center location
of a relatively plain (excepting the obvious) run between west and east
ends.

  The end of this hall offers nothing new that hasn't been seen so far;
every aspect of the surroundings appear to be crafted from the same single
sheet of diamond, carved perhaps by some deity's hand into this single-path
walkway between layers.  Another set of diamond lumps stick out and trail
down the side of the wall at the end here, offering easy descension.

  A rune-laden door is seen halting further advance to the west,
inscribed with various lunar symbols all upon its surface.  The diamond
exterior surface can be seen thinning significantly as it reaches the edge
of this door, with the (thankful) exception of the ground, which remains as
sturdy as ever.  Gleaming lumps of diamond extend from the eastern wall
here, leading up to a higher floor above.

out considerably in lieu of the walls dissolving around it.  A wide symbol
is seen upon the unsteady surface in the middle of the area, looking
planetary in design.

  A lonely sheet of diamond is all that is left at the end of this
pseudo-hall, overlooking the vast expanse of black void that is yet-beset
with the ever-present thermal orb deep in the abyss.  The walls and ceiling

railings lead on either side of you from this localized balcony down to the
ground floor, which extends widely in all directions up to a point where the
emptiness of space returns, overtaking the ends of the room in a guardless
plummet over each edge.  Looming tall in the middle of the whole area, a
segmented pyramid rises up from the floor tens of feet in the air, towering
in the colorless atmosphere above everything else.  Since there is no
ceiling to speak of, looking up and around will net you glances of layers
past, floating in the abyss by no normal means; they simply seem to exist,
frozen in place within this lunar core.

  A winding spiral of warped glass leads around in several concentric

a gradual decline en route to the aforementioned location.  With no wall
to put one's back against, the horizon-set energy sphere far in the back of

  In sharp contrast to every cave explored on the moon thus far, a
pearlescent finish is smoothed over the surfaces of this room, creating a
glossy frame amidst the still-bumpy exterior of wall, ceiling and floor. 
Humid warmth flows into the area from downstairs, which a narrow set of
stone steps gradually descends into, and with that heat comes a source of
light, removing all trace of darkness exemplified by being this far under
the lunar surface.  A pair of large metal doors is lined up against the

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.

[Player Housing] Slurmp's Dazzling Abode
  This room's architect was clearly well-aware of the dangers posed by irresponsible letter manipulation, because there's barely an un-adjectivized noun present. The walls are a putrid plaid, the ceiling holds a whirling disco ball, and even the bed is 'comfortable looking' ('bed' is notably resistant to most removal techniques, anyways). A poster of Atlantida fills the wall and seems to be watching you. Otherwise, there's not much here.

Brigantes Castle - Gateway of Kings
  At the bottom of a long and winding fight of stairs is a set of massive
double doors.  They are old and faded, but still etched with scenes
depicting great kings and large battles.  The walls are of cracked stone,
and the area before the doors is not much more than an empty well.  The
floor was once a cobbled pathway, and the cobblestones continue under the
gate. Stairs lead back up to the surface.

Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle
  The cobbling of this stone road is ancient and chipped.  A piece of
wood hanging from a crumbling wall declares this circular road "Voodoo
Circle."  Small partitions are huddled together on both sides of the road
like houses and shops, making it appear as though a whole city once existed
inside these castle walls.  The ceiling is magically enchanted to always
look like the night sky, and bats flutter about in the darkness.

Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle
  The stone passageways encasing the city are icy cold.  There are
advantages to living inside an underground castle, but heat is not one of
them.  All of the buildings off this stretch of Voodoo Circle are garishly
lit with red lanterns and bobbing lights.  To the west is the main gate to
the castle, and the Circle continues to the northeast.  A door is carved in
the southern wall, as well as a window which is emitting pink fog.

Brigantes Castle - Voodoo Circle
  Each step makes a clicking sound against the rough cobbling of the
uneven floor.  Deep cracks line the walls in which triangular windows have
been placed equidistantly.  Although the castle is underground, and the
windows really view a wall of dirt and stone, they have been magically
enchanted like the ceiling to peer out into a starlit night.  To the
southwest and north, Voodoo Circle continues.

  Forming a wide archway to the east, the stone tiling of the castle
walls give way to a plain house door.  Bats flutter in the night here,
following the curve of Voodoo Circle to the south where there is litle
light.  Several small, unseen creatures go skittering along the curving
northwestern path into the darkness.  Tacked against the western wall is the
Brigantes bulletin board.

  Spiderwebs clog the corners of the windows and doors along this
passage, shrouding you in ancient gloom.  Bits of straw are protruding from
under the northeast door, as well as various animal noises and smells.  The
southeast path sprawls off into the darkness of the Circle, while the
western hallway meets a convergance of paths.  Dust motes lazily drift along
both passages, disturbed by the townsfolk traversing the ancient halls.

  Forming the top of a perfectly round hallway with the rest of the
Voodoo Circle continuing east and west, this hallway is especially wide. 
The dull brown cobblestones paving the street transition into shining stones
of deep onyx on the northern street.  A magical breeze blows through one of
the windows in the wall, completely artificial and not chilling at all. 
Because the dark castle is so far below the ground, all the windows have
been sealed with stone and enchanted like the ceiling to peer out into the
night sky.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Paved with deep ebony stones that reflect the starlight above, this
street glimmers sinisterly.  The corners of the walls are studded with stone
gargoyle heads and carved faces of humans in pain.  The statue of a
beautiful woman, wrapped in bat-like wings, levitates unassisted above and
lights the room with the fire eternally burning in its mouth.  To the south,
the street is cobbled with dull brown stones rather than the jet black
stones here.  To the east and west, the onyx pathway is paved.  To the
north, set of french doors is half-hanging open.

  Spidering off at sharp angles, the onyx-studded street forms a junction
here.  To the west is a blazing statue hovering at the ceiling.  The heavy
door to the southeast is closed, and murky black mist seems to radiate
through the cracks.  Passing under the malevolent gaze of a row of stone
vampire statues, the widest path continues to the northeast.  A single black
crow can be seen through the dark castle windows, ever-circling the full
moon.

  Masterfully sculpted from the heavy stone of the castle, several
inanimate hands are reaching out from the walls on either side of this eerie
hall.  Next to the southwestern bend, several statues are being held by the
carved stone hands.  They are undead masters of the night, and cast their
terrifying vampiric gaze upon anyone who traverses the glittering onyx-paved
street.  A break in the eastern wall has been fitted with a shoddy,
ill-fitting doorframe with a sloppily scribbled shop sign hung on the door. 
The path leading around the northwest corner descends into an inky murk of

Brigantes Castle - Pip's Pawn Shop
  This shop is so full of random objects and incoherent displays that it
is entirely claustrophobic to anyone inside.  Old swords, single gloves, and
other mismatched equipment lie scattered around.  The largest shelf holds
many empty bottles, a pocketwatch, a stuffed Rabite and several waterlogged
books.  Amid the hodgepodge of possessions, one table has been kept clear
and a chair put behind it.  A very bright lamp, shaped like a severed leg
and resting on the back table, is the only source of harsh illumination.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Masterfully sculpted from the heavy stone of the castle, several
inanimate hands are reaching out from the walls on either side of this eerie
hall.  Next to the southwestern bend, several statues are being held by the
carved stone hands.  They are undead masters of the night, and cast their
terrifying vampiric gaze upon anyone who traverses the glittering onyx-paved
street.  A break in the eastern wall has been fitted with a shoddy,
ill-fitting doorframe with a sloppily scribbled shop sign hung on the door. 
The path leading around the northwest corner descends into an inky murk of
damp and heavy fog.   
(] Exits: east nw sw [)
A bobbing lantern is here, carried by a flapping bat.
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the east.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Spidering off at sharp angles, the onyx-studded street forms a junction
here.  To the west is a blazing statue hovering at the ceiling.  The heavy
door to the southeast is closed, and murky black mist seems to radiate
through the cracks.  Passing under the malevolent gaze of a row of stone
vampire statues, the widest path continues to the northeast.  A single black
crow can be seen through the dark castle windows, ever-circling the full
moon.   
(] Exits: west ne [se] [)
A young pumpkinhead is loitering around suspiciously.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Paved with deep ebony stones that reflect the starlight above, this
street glimmers sinisterly.  The corners of the walls are studded with stone
gargoyle heads and carved faces of humans in pain.  The statue of a
beautiful woman, wrapped in bat-like wings, levitates unassisted above and
lights the room with the fire eternally burning in its mouth.  To the south,
the street is cobbled with dull brown stones rather than the jet black
stones here.  To the east and west, the onyx pathway is paved.  To the
north, set of french doors is half-hanging open.   
(] Exits: north east south west [)

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Chains are screwed into the walls here, restraining what would appear
to be hands reaching out of the walls.  In the palm of each hand is a small
purple flame, lighting this corridor with an eerie glow.  The onyx-studded
road subtly sparkles with muted tones of the fuschia fire.  To the east, a
floating statue illuminates the promenade.  To the northwest, the eerie path
comes to a sharp, angular junction.

Brigantes Castle - Nightmare Promenade
  Grotesque stone carvings jut from the castle walls, terrifying
charicatures of screaming faces trying to break free.  Unlike the eastern
road, only a single torch-holding hand lights the passage.  A passage shoots
off at a sharp angle to the south, bypassing a door covered with cobwebs and
labeled BANK in several languages.  To the northeast and southeast,
Nightmare Promenade continues its circular flow.  To the north, a beastly
claw is lazily drifting about, clutching a Sorcery Street sign.  The sounds
of neighing and stamping seem to come from the west.

Brigantes Castle - Beastly Bank
  The most prominent architecture in the room are the metal bars behind
which the banker is protected.  They are formed like a spiderweb in front of
the counter through which citizens pass their money for safe deposit.  Real
spiders of the non-metal variety seem to have taken a liking to the
protective bars as well, spinning their own long-forgotten cobwebs among the
false gossamer.  The marble counter and floor are chipped and cracked, but
the massive stone vault in the back wall seems to be in perfect condition. 
A door with a bell attached to it leads back out onto the northern Nightmare
Promenade.   
(] Exits: north [)
     A monocle is lying here in a little pool of slime.
     Several boxy steel lockers have been installed along the wall.

Brigantes Castle - Sorcery Street
   The pavement of this street differs from that of the Promenade to the
south.  Rather than deep black gemstones or cobblestones, the floor is
smoothed concrete and micah.  Every step makes the floor glitter with a
thousand golden pinpoints.  A fountain here is pouring out rainbow-colored
water in the center of the Y-shaped intersection.  To the northeast and
northwest are the two different branches of Sorcery Street.  There is a
bustling kitchen to the west.

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.  
(] Exits: north west [)
A man shrouded in a dark blue robe and a pointed hat awaits your request.
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the east.

Onrac - Village Cemetary
  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.  
(] Exits: south west [)
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the south.

Onrac - Crossroads
  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a
northern church, the western entrance of the village proper, and the general
rest of the village to the south.  Cries of seagulls punctuate the
west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear
blue sky.  
(] Exits: [north] east south west [)
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the east.

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.  
(] Exits: north east [)
     A vivid pink warp pipe juts out of the ground, leading somewhere!
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the east.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
     A Christmas tree stands here, adorned with holiday decorations.
(Pink Aura) Gforte is resting on a fountainside bench.
Tiny electric lights blink and flicker up and down the street.
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard has arrived through a pink warp pipe.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.  
(] Exits: north east south west [)
     A small satchel sits here, of a slightly sticky, silken substance.
A mustachioed musician cranks a music box here, monkey perched on his shoulder.
Tiny electric lights blink and flicker up and down the street.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.  
(] Exits: east [)
     A chunk of obsidian is here, being miniscule.
     ( 2) A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
     A pair of spider fangs have been left here, dripping with black ichor.
     Several boxy steel lockers have been installed along the wall.
     A box rests on the counter, potentially full of missing things.
Paladin Slurmp the Newbie is here.
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,
stuffed full of single-file palm trees, divides it in two.  The building to
the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

Truce - Pier
  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet
chatter from ten feet below.

  The pier turns a corner here, offering an unobstructed view of the
endless waves lazily rolling across the Western Sea.  In the opposite
direction, the homes and shops of Truce stand all abreast along the

pointing northeast.

familiar face.

  Parks make most of this end of the city.  One is immediately to the
north, with a concrete path winding through it.  Not far to the south, an
unusually large skyscraper dominates the skyline, but can't be accessed from
any roads on this side.  The road itself ends in a curb-lined circle of
pavement, which itself is surrounded by grass.

Shrike - Intersection of Main and Kohryuu
  This intersection is the center of the downtown area, with a few tall
buildings on the corners.  A playground takes up one corner, and a few
people loiter about, with nothing better to do.  A strip of lush grass
between the road and the sidewalk holds a row of cherry trees.  The air is
clean and fresh, with no trace of the irritating pollutants found in other
large cities.

Gringey City - The Docks
  The creaky dock here is made of wood and cement, large pillars with
ropes tied to them being the only barrier between the dock and the water. 
The dock is quite spacious, though it does seem a little creaky.  It gives a
vast view of the water, which is unfortunately not very nice looking, as
there is trash floating around and slick foam coating it.  Despite how gross
everything is, there are many ferries parked here.

She is dependable to sell ferry tickets for their intended prices and put the money in the cash register, but refuses to do side work or work holidays. All in all, she's the best Gringey City could do when it came to ferry booth workers, so she has rather high job security.

tall but still taking up a large chunk of the available space, the only
apparent entrance to it located along the street here.  The sidewalk is kept
in good shape, mostly free of litter, with obvious paint patches covering
several large areas.  The road leads west, toward the city limits, while it

Chobins are rodent-like bipedal humanoids that are known the world over
for their thievery.  They wear cloaks with hoods as a general rule, but
these particularly sneaky thieves wear masks over their face as well, fully
cloaking themselves to mask their identities.  It's only up to speculation
what else they might be concealing, but there is not much to see on the
surface under a dark mask, hood, and cloak.  If it weren't for the nose and
whiskers poking out of the mask and the hairless tail waving about behind,
they might appear to look like ghosts.

Gringey City - Street
  The street is blotchy with dark spots, small bits of debris and litter
gathered up along the gutterside.  A tall, but narrow building is accessible
to the north while the road leads east into the grimy city.  Gazing toward

Gringey City - Street
  The street curves around several buildings on either side toward the
southeast, the entrances for all of them elsewhere, heading closer to the
oceanside.  The road leads west toward the heart of Gringey City, smoke
lazily rising upwards from many industrial buildings in view.

Gringey City - The Mayor's House
  The mayor of Gringey City's house is smaller than one would expect for
a mayor, perhaps showing humility in office.  It is clean and nicely
decorated, free of clutter and generally quite cozy and pleasant, here.  The
floor plan is fully open, things like couches and large shelves creating the
walls for different rooms.  What seems like the dining room has quite the
large table, likely for entertaining guests.

The maid is a large, curly haired human woman. She's dressed for work in a nicely ironed, long sleeve, black button down shirt, buttoned up to the neck. Her trousers are a lighter grey color, good for a medium between hiding dust and debris and other dirt that may find itself on her clothing. She appears mostly unconcerned about things, though the house DOES look very nice.

  The street curves around several buildings on either side toward the

oceanside.  The road leads west toward the heart of Gringey City, smoke
lazily rising upwards from many industrial buildings in view.

  The streets of the city are black asphalt with many obvious darker
spots and lines where potholes and cracks have been filled in.  A large

 1  Gringey City - The Mayor's House - 4 rooms away                             
  The mayor of Gringey City's house is smaller than one would expect for
a mayor, perhaps showing humility in office.  It is clean and nicely
decorated, free of clutter and generally quite cozy and pleasant, here.  The
floor plan is fully open, things like couches and large shelves creating the
walls for different rooms.  What seems like the dining room has quite the
large table, likely for entertaining guests.   
 2  Gringey City - Condemned Building - 8 rooms away                            
  The building here looks like it was hastily evacuated, perhaps due to
an eviction, many personal belongings remaining.  However, it also appears
like this happened many years ago, as everything is falling to pieces and
covered in grime.  Many things look chewed by rats, along with some nests
that had been made by them.  The blown out door to the northeast leads back
into the city.   
 3  Mushroom Cave - Entrance - 13 rooms away                                    
  The smell of mulch wafts from deeper inside the cave, a cloying musty earthy smell.   Moist plant residue is scattered here and there throughout the cave floor, dampening the walkways.  Countless mushrooms proliferate along the walls of the cave, which alternate between stone grey and mossy green.  Although there is light here near the entrance, the cave seems to grow much darker further inside to the northeast. 
There were 580 matches which I could not find a path to within 300 rooms.

Gringey City - Street
  A large building blocks the view toward the north, the entrance
appearing to be further east, while a tall cement barrier toward the south
keeps the ocean out of sight and out of mind.  The street is mottled dark
with patches, slapdash work in filling in potholes and various cracks,
leading east and west and not doing much else of interest.

Gringey City - Street
  The ocean is barred off from the city with a high-rising, cement
barrier toward the south.  The sweet smell of salty ocean water is not found
here, consumed instead by the heavy scent of gasoline and exhaust.  The road
continues toward the east, leading toward a particularly large building and
the eastern gate to the city, while it leads northwest further into the
city.

Gringey City - Street
  The street curves around several buildings on either side toward the
southeast, the entrances for all of them elsewhere, heading closer to the
oceanside.  The road leads west toward the heart of Gringey City, smoke
lazily rising upwards from many industrial buildings in view.

Gringey City - Street
  The streets of the city are black asphalt with many obvious darker
spots and lines where potholes and cracks have been filled in.  A large
manhole is in the middle of the street, periodically steaming.  The
sidewalks are only slightly worse for wear, but not even weeds are
interested in taking root in the dirt that has collected there.  The city
rises up in most directions, while the street itself gives several options
of directions to either the east, northeast, or south.

Gringey City - Street
  It appears to almost be an intentionally kept secret that the ocean is
immediately to the south, a large concrete construction creating a solid
wall to block access - intentional or accidental.  The street curves here,
leading north and west, through the concrete forest of monotonous buildings
rising up, some of them spewing smoke into the air.  The building toward the
east does not appear to be creating any type of pollution.

Gringey City - Street
  The road leads east and northwest, coming close to the ocean to the
south, here.  Toward the northwest, the road begins to thread itself
inbetween a tight collection of buildings, several of them appearing to
utilize the ocean itself - to the disadvantage of the waters.  The majority
of the view south is blocked by a concrete barrier, but as the road curves
northwest, the ocean is somewhat visible through a less-secure chain-link
fence.

Gringey City - Street
  The building to the north wraps around the road to the east, not very
tall but still taking up a large chunk of the available space, the only
apparent entrance to it located along the street here.  The sidewalk is kept
in good shape, mostly free of litter, with obvious paint patches covering
several large areas.  The road leads west, toward the city limits, while it
curves southeast toward the ocean.  A condemned building to the southwest
appears to have had someone attempt to break into it, with a large crack in
the door.

Gringey City - Street
  The street is blotchy with dark spots, small bits of debris and litter
gathered up along the gutterside.  A tall, but narrow building is accessible
to the north while the road leads east into the grimy city.  Gazing toward
the sky, smoke can be seen huffing and puffing upwards, unheeded.  The
western gate to the city can be seen just a small ways further to the,
obviously, west.

  The western gate of Gringey City leads into the concrete jungle that
rises up against the shore to the dismay of nature.  The air becomes heavy
with the stink of exhaust quite quickly as it rudely drifts all around.  The
sky toward the west appears to clear up considerably further away, the
choking smog seemingly containing itself overtop of the city sky
intentionally.

Shadmire - Shoreline Road
  The road here leads east into a city, a forboding aura seemingly
emanating from the city itself.  The land meets the ocean in a somewhat
rocky, sandy shore, but the shore is sadly covered in garbage.  The road
leads west, but is blocked off with a large sign that reads UNDER
CONSTRUCTION.  A dirt path, however, leads northwest toward the mountains.

  The air becomes drier quickly in this area near the mountains, compared

far toward the southeast, and what looks like a cave might be to the

Gringey City - Condemned Building
  The building here looks like it was hastily evacuated, perhaps due to
an eviction, many personal belongings remaining.  However, it also appears
like this happened many years ago, as everything is falling to pieces and
covered in grime.  Many things look chewed by rats, along with some nests
that had been made by them.  The blown out door to the northeast leads back
into the city.

Gringey City - Street
  The building to the north wraps around the road to the east, not very
tall but still taking up a large chunk of the available space, the only
apparent entrance to it located along the street here.  The sidewalk is kept
in good shape, mostly free of litter, with obvious paint patches covering
several large areas.  The road leads west, toward the city limits, while it
curves southeast toward the ocean.  A condemned building to the southwest
appears to have had someone attempt to break into it, with a large crack in
the door.

Gringey City - Street
  The street is blotchy with dark spots, small bits of debris and litter
gathered up along the gutterside.  A tall, but narrow building is accessible
to the north while the road leads east into the grimy city.  Gazing toward
the sky, smoke can be seen huffing and puffing upwards, unheeded.  The
western gate to the city can be seen just a small ways further to the,
obviously, west.

Gringey City - West Gate
  The western gate of Gringey City leads into the concrete jungle that
rises up against the shore to the dismay of nature.  The air becomes heavy
with the stink of exhaust quite quickly as it rudely drifts all around.  The
sky toward the west appears to clear up considerably further away, the
choking smog seemingly containing itself overtop of the city sky
intentionally.

Shadmire - Shoreline Road
  The road here leads east into a city, a forboding aura seemingly
emanating from the city itself.  The land meets the ocean in a somewhat
rocky, sandy shore, but the shore is sadly covered in garbage.  The road
leads west, but is blocked off with a large sign that reads UNDER
CONSTRUCTION.  A dirt path, however, leads northwest toward the mountains.

Shadmire - Mountain Path
  The air becomes drier quickly in this area near the mountains, compared
to the ocean shore to the southeast.  The elevation rises enough to see the
desert far beyond to the north, stretching for miles.  A city can be seen
far toward the southeast, and what looks like a cave might be to the
northwest.

Onrac - Glenwood's Black Magic
  Encircled by hedges and a scant rim of black roses, this conical building
seems to be lacking any sort of doorway or even windows.  Twin gargoyles
rest upon its eaves, and a dark purple gazebo made of enameled brass looms
in front, holding a table with a wide assortment of arcane incantations.

  Many headstones lies in rows upon the grassy square that has been set
aside for burying the local deceased.  A large number of them are
significantly fades and worn away from the passage of time, and a thin fence
made of layered wire wraps around the outside edge, perhaps to keep out the
local wildlife.

  All cardinal directions open up here, leading to an eastern cemetary, a

west-blowing breeze, their plump white bodies clearly visible in the clear

Secluded Seaside Settlement, Onrac
  Sparsely surrounded by woods and offering only beaten paths for roads,
the small town of Onrac expands in a mostly-eastern fashion, sidled by a
great sea on its eastern bank.  A salty smell hangs in the air, and fresh
breezes are a frequent and common thing.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Truce - Pier
  Cobblestones give way to wooden planks as the road transitions into a
pier, jutting off the shore and protruding into the ocean.  The pier easily
measures twenty feet across, and curved guardrails stick up on either side. 
A narrow ladder hangs off the side of the pier, descending to somewhere near
the water line.

Truce - Pier
  Waves continually lap at the pylons beneath the pier, dispersing little
clouds of ocean spray and ringing the pylons with foam.  The generations of
barnacles holding fast don't seem to mind.  Pier-goers shouldn't mind
either, as the pier is so elevated that the ocean's commotion is just quiet
chatter from ten feet below.

[Player Housing] Altar of the Serpent
  Hidden within the depths of Hell, and guarded by the Demon Lord himself,
lies the Altar of the Serpent. Intensely realistic paintings line the wall,
depicting scenes of battle between the Demons and the humans. The chamber
is dimly lit by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax.
The smell of their smoke hits your nose, along with an odor that is 
reminiscent of the jungle. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and
drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor, with the candles situated
equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a
black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight. Hanging above
the altar lies a human skull, only partly decomposed. Two silver statues of
serpents sit atop the altar, each one containing a human eye within its
mouth.
(] Exits: north south [)
     A pale bluish-green roll of parchment sits on the floor.
     A psychedelic-patterend truffle with a magic glow sits here.
     A rolled-up bit of parchment is here, sporting an armor seal.
     (37) A packed ball of snow is lying here, waiting to be tossed.
     A large statue of a snake spills a limitless amount of nourishing liquid from its mouth.
[Asmodeus] and the Nessian guard flies in from the north.
