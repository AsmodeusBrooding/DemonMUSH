Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

     A long, flexible wooden fishing pole sits here on the ground.

Truce - South of Fountain
  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,

the west has a giant gold coin mounted on it, and the building to the east
sports the word "TOURIST" on an oversized sign.

arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

Free City, Truce - Fountain
  A tiered fountain marks the center of Truce, water gushing from its
summit and trickling into a deep, wide basin, wrapped by a ring of benches. 
Roads flow like rivers away from the fountain, and houses sprout like weeds
all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.  

(] Exits: north east south west [)
     A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
     A long, flexible wooden fishing pole sits here on the ground.
     The fountain of Truce pours streams of drinkable water here.
     A blue warp pipe thrusts out of the ground here, leading to...?
(Charmed) An excitable bipedal cat is here, bouncing from foot to foot.

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.

  A checkerboard of tiled stone spreads southward.  A brick planter,

all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

Fun City - West Plaza Square
  You are at the west end of a large rectangular road that leads
around a brightly-lit building directly to the east.  The laughter and
general merriment of children (and some adults!) is in full effect, and
this place seems to be living up to its name quite well.  A standing
billboard with a large blue arrow, pointing west, seems to indicate nearby
attractions.

various slips of paper laid out upon them, some stamped and some not.

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For the majority of your acquisitions, please have them on your person and not in personal containers, then speak the phrase, "I am ready for scanning."  I will assess all potential singular objects, such as vouchers, that qualify for redemption, then remove them and and reward you appropriately.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For Golden Koi exchanges, please speak the phrase, "Fish me up."  For Snowman Smasher Medals (all types), speak the phrase, "Snow me down."'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'These processes may only be applied one time each, so be sure you have acquired anything that you plan to.  If you have objects not desired for exchange, either stow them in a personal locker storage or ask a friend to temporarily hold them for you.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For collection objects such as Golden Koi and Snowman Smasher Medals, all will be removed and you will be given a reward based on the highest collection tier that you have reached with them.  If you collect more after being scanned, you may give them directly for a minor reward per object.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'If you have an Azure Snowball, please give it to me directly for your reward.  Remember that this only applies if you have exhausted all but a single use.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For security and integrity purposes, I cannot inform you of the exchange result of any given acquisition until after it is given to you.'

Exchange this interesting coin to Lilly to get a non-weapon piece of
equipment changed into a container!  (Don't ask how the physics work for
certain items, just accept that they do).  The first instance of this token's
use will create a container out of the item that can hold 10 items and
20 pounds of weight.  Each additional token used on the same item will
have a cumulative effect, adding an addition 10 items and 20 weight
capacity to the item in question, up to a maximum of 500item/1000weight.

  A dazzling array of lights hang across the ceiling and upper reaches of

The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'Congratulations on your accomplishments this year.  Please allow me to provide exchanges for various extra objects you may have accumulated during the week.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For the majority of your acquisitions, please have them on your person and not in personal containers, then speak the phrase, "I am ready for scanning."  I will assess all potential singular objects, such as vouchers, that qualify for redemption, then remove them and and reward you appropriately.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For Golden Koi exchanges, please speak the phrase, "Fish me up."  For Snowman Smasher Medals (all types), speak the phrase, "Snow me down."'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'These processes may only be applied one time each, so be sure you have acquired anything that you plan to.  If you have objects not desired for exchange, either stow them in a personal locker storage or ask a friend to temporarily hold them for you.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For collection objects such as Golden Koi and Snowman Smasher Medals, all will be removed and you will be given a reward based on the highest collection tier that you have reached with them.  If you collect more after being scanned, you may give them directly for a minor reward per object.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'If you have an Azure Snowball, please give it to me directly for your reward.  Remember that this only applies if you have exhausted all but a single use.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For security and integrity purposes, I cannot inform you of the exchange result of any given acquisition until after it is given to you.'

Very, very quietly, The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh whispers 'Beep.'

You think, "What are the prize tiers for Koi and Medals?"

l bond
This rare substance has the power to meld together two different items
into one, maintaining (most of) their properties and taking on a shape that
resembles one, the other, or both.  
 
You may exchange this item to Lilly in order to fuse together two different
items, effectively combining their stats into a single object.  The
following rules apply for the fusion process, and are subject to Lilly's
overarching discretion on a case-by-case basis:
 
A (Lesser) Bonding Core allows fusion of items up to level 30.
A (Greater) Bonding Core allows fusion of items up to level 50.
An (Ultimate) Bonding Core allows fusion of items up to level 100.
 
-Unique items cannot be fused with anything else in any capacity. Use of a
Normifier Signet does not alter this restrictions.
-HP/Mana/Moves may not exceed 400, and Damroll/Magroll may not exceed 10,
when fusing together items with multiple values of the above.
-Items cloned using a Token of Limited Cloning cannot be fused with the item
it was cloned from, nor can it be fused with a cloned item from anything else.
-Items created by this fusion process cannot be fused again with any other
item.
-Fused objects will take on the higher of the item levels between the two.
-Weapons will take on the higher average between the two being fused.
 
More restrictions may apply, and again, are left to Lilly's discretion.

l hikarium
This is an outstanding synthetic mineral the likes of which is not often
seen outside of high-end laboratories at Fukawa Industries, Inc.  You must
be a very lucky person to come into possession of it!  The value in it alone
is massive compared to other gems and minerals, but it's possible that you
may find another use for it, sometime down the road, too.

Hikari no Matsuri - Room of Triumph
  A dazzling array of lights hang across the ceiling and upper reaches of
all four walls in this room, mostly white but interspersed with pink and
blue as well.  A massive machine is built seemingly right into the wooden
wall on the other end of the room, loking very purposeful in design.   

(] Exits: west [)
     A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
(Charmed) A huge rafflesia plant walks around here.
A huge cylinder looms over the area, offering more slots than an American casino.

You talk to The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh.
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'SYSTEMS ONLINE.'
... ...
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'Congratulations on your accomplishments this year.  Please allow me to provide exchanges for various extra objects you may have accumulated during the week.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For the majority of your acquisitions, please have them on your person and not in personal containers, then speak the phrase, "I am ready for scanning."  I will assess all potential singular objects, such as vouchers, that qualify for redemption, then remove them and and reward you appropriately.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For Golden Koi exchanges, please speak the phrase, "Fish me up."  For Snowman Smasher Medals (all types), speak the phrase, "Snow me down."'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'These processes may only be applied one time each, so be sure you have acquired anything that you plan to.  If you have objects not desired for exchange, either stow them in a personal locker storage or ask a friend to temporarily hold them for you.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For collection objects such as Golden Koi and Snowman Smasher Medals, all will be removed and you will be given a reward based on the highest collection tier that you have reached with them.  If you collect more after being scanned, you may give them directly for a minor reward per object.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'If you have an Azure Snowball, please give it to me directly for your reward.  Remember that this only applies if you have exhausted all but a single use.'
The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh says 'For security and integrity purposes, I cannot inform you of the exchange result of any given acquisition until after it is given to you.'

Very, very quietly, The Redeemer Two-Point-Oh whispers 'Beep.'

You think, "What are the prize tiers for Koi and Medals?"

l loop
This bizarre device looks like a hand-sized silver hoop, except that its
interior appears to be filled with some sort of purple-y space-and-void type
stuff.  Putting your hand through the center of reveals that said hand does
not come out the other side!  This precious item can be exchanged to Lilly
to allow you to break the rules a single time - you may transfer ONE (1)
item from a different character that you own, and give it to the character
that is exchanging the Loop-Hole.  It's all the fun of being a criminal with
none of the backlash!  
 
Loop-Holes can also come in an (ASTRAL) variety, as well.  This upgraded
version allows you to transfer THREE (3) items from a different character
you own!

Hikari no Matsuri - Room of Triumph
  A dazzling array of lights hang across the ceiling and upper reaches of
all four walls in this room, mostly white but interspersed with pink and
blue as well.  A massive machine is built seemingly right into the wooden
wall on the other end of the room, loking very purposeful in design.

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Secondary Exchange Stall
  This is... kind of like a stall.  Sort of.  It's a little more
basement-y than the room above it.  A stone room with very little
accommodations, there seems to be only a lone machine in the corner, and
stairs leading back up.   There is also a large wooden sign on the
wall, listing prizes that can be traded for precious Golden Jingle
Bells!

Hikari no Matsuri - Tertiary Exchange Stall
  This room is also kind of like a stall, except even more basement-y
than the room above it.  Actually, it's really not anything like a stall,
it's literally just a stone room with a single machine in the corner.  It's
almost like the staff were running out of places to put things.   There
is a large wooden sign on the wall, listing prizes that can be traded
for rare and elusive Diamond Jingle Bells! Of note, there appears to be

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Starlit Attic
  The star-studded sky shines luminously into this room from a very
wide window taking up much of this upper room's ceiling.  It is, by the
by, not a large room when compared to the stall below, but it is big enough
to hold a fancy-looking machine in the back.  A sturdy metal ladder
slips through a round hole, leading back below.

Hikari no Matsuri - Secondary Exchange Stall
  This is... kind of like a stall.  Sort of.  It's a little more
basement-y than the room above it.  A stone room with very little
accommodations, there seems to be only a lone machine in the corner, and
stairs leading back up.   There is also a large wooden sign on the
wall, listing prizes that can be traded for precious Golden Jingle
Bells!

(] Exits: up down [)
(Charmed) A huge rafflesia plant walks around here.
A somewhat-dusty machine is here, waiting to trade up your Jingle Bells for loot!

l unfilt
This misty bluish-green block has an open seam that runs horizontally (or
is it vertically?)  Across the length of it, allowing one to pry it open
when ready to use.  The pure mana vapors inside will find a host weapon to
imbue, granting that weapon the 'Mystic' flag and allowing the wielder's
Magroll to provide extra damage instead of Damroll.

This odd disclike device looks like a slightly-raised green and black

Hikari no Matsuri - Tertiary Exchange Stall
  This room is also kind of like a stall, except even more basement-y
than the room above it.  Actually, it's really not anything like a stall,
it's literally just a stone room with a single machine in the corner.  It's
almost like the staff were running out of places to put things.   There
is a large wooden sign on the wall, listing prizes that can be traded
for rare and elusive Diamond Jingle Bells! Of note, there appears to be
  [There is no description written for this room]

a stone door carved into the wooden floor, with a metallic ring pull-handle
providing access further downstairs.

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

(] Exits: east [west] up down [se] [)
(Charmed) A huge rafflesia plant walks around here.
[AFK] AKKURSED Demonicor Forsaken is here.
A splendid machine is here, waiting to trade up your Jingle Bells for loot!

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

(Charmed) A huge rafflesia plant walks around here.
[AFK] AKKURSED Demonicor Forsaken is here.
A splendid machine is here, waiting to trade up your Jingle Bells for loot!

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Secondary Exchange Stall
  This is... kind of like a stall.  Sort of.  It's a little more
basement-y than the room above it.  A stone room with very little
accommodations, there seems to be only a lone machine in the corner, and
stairs leading back up.   There is also a large wooden sign on the
wall, listing prizes that can be traded for precious Golden Jingle
Bells!

Hikari no Matsuri - Exchange Stall
   This stall is simple and relatively uninteresting, save for the giant
wooden sign hanging up on the entirety of the north wall, depicting prizes
upon prizes that can be won with Silver Jingle Bells earned from many of the
festival games and activities.  A fancy-pants machine sits in the far
corner at the edge of the sign, and a staircase nearby leads down to other
equivalent-style machines that will accept rarer Jingle Bell currencies!
Alternately, there is a side room to the east with additional exchange
mechanisms, and a wall-grafted ladder leads up through a trapdoor into
another room above.

Hikari no Matsuri - Room of Triumph
  A dazzling array of lights hang across the ceiling and upper reaches of
all four walls in this room, mostly white but interspersed with pink and
blue as well.  A massive machine is built seemingly right into the wooden
wall on the other end of the room, loking very purposeful in design.

     A pitch-black cauldron is simmering here, vapors rising from within.
A huge cylinder looms over the area, offering more slots than an American casino.

Fun City - West Plaza Square
  You are at the west end of a large rectangular road that leads
around a brightly-lit building directly to the east.  The laughter and
general merriment of children (and some adults!) is in full effect, and
this place seems to be living up to its name quite well.  A standing
billboard with a large blue arrow, pointing west, seems to indicate nearby
attractions.

  You are at the northwest end of a large rectangular road that leads
around a brightly-lit building directly to the southeast.  The laughter and
general merriment of children (and some adults!) is in full effect, and
this palce seems to be living up to its name quite well.  A standing
billboard with a large green arrow, pointing northwest, seems to indicate
nearby attractions.

  A giant shrubbery is set within a circular garden in the middle of the

south on either side.  Immensely-tall sunflowers spring tall as a backdrop,
and all manner of flora decorates the immediate landscape.  A very small,

Fun City - North Plaza Square
  You are at the north end of a large rectangular road that leads
around a brightly-lit building directly to the south.  The laughter and
general merriment of children (and some adults!) is in full effect, and
this place seems to be living up to its name quite well.  A standing
billboard with a large red arrow, pointing north, seems to indicate nearby
attractions.

  A magnificant walled city spreads out from here to the north, adorned
with golden accents and throngs of pink ribbon wherever necessary (and
unnecessary, too).  A tall black gate leads directly inside, and judging by

and the air drier.  Beetles are prominent here, some flying through the air,
others burrowing into the soil.  A dirt road substantiates itself and bends
to the northwest, while grassier lands lie eastward.  

(] Exits: east west [)
A blue droplet of viscous liquid, a slime scrunches around here.

Guardia - A Winding Dirt Path
  The dirt trail progresses here, swerving around the rising rock ground. 
Bits of weed line the path, but they get more sparse as one travels
northward.  Footprints follow nonsensical paths through the dust, evidence
of old beetle hunts.  The path continues northwest, while a field rises to
the east.

Guardia - A Winding Dirt Path
  The dirt trail grows thicker, and ground to the west rises up into a
cliff.  A scattering of trees appears to the northwest, although they appear to
be dead.  Dust on the ground is stirred up by a gust of wind, finding its
way into one's nostrils.  Greener pastures are to the southeast.

Guardia - Lifeless Glade
  A circle of very tall yet dead trees stands here, forming a glen.  The
trees are browned and gnarled and look to have been in such a state for
quite a while, yet their dead leafs still hang on them.  A layer of mulch
and tangled weeds covers the ground, enmeshing the feet of anyone walking.

  The trees here stand in two parallel rows, making a lane that leads out

possibly a maintained garden long ago, now abandoned.

  A peaceful community of old and young alike has formed around the failed
rocket in the back of the town.  The houses are built from fine oak that
belonged to the trees that were settled around the launchpad before the
homes were built.  To the west is a home with a banner that displays two
crossed swords while to the east is an inn.  To the north is the center of

Rocket Town - Center of Rocket Town
  The large clearing that makes up the center of Rocket Town is a mixture
of gravel, concrete, and dirt.  In patches where enough dirt has
accumulated, some beautiful trees have grown.  For the most part though, the
trees are limited to the outskirts of the town.  A large rocket that is
leaning at a peculiar angle lies to the north behind the town.  Homes
surround the clearing but the only ones that are open to visitors at the
moment are to the northwest and northeast.

Rocket Town - Suburb
  Just on the outskirts of Rocket Town, the road simultaneously widens and
stops, forming a wide circle of dirt, surrounded by homes on all sides, save
the east.  The Rocket rises a distance to the northeast, behind a few houses
and trees, appearing as some kind of monument.  The soil making up the area
has been compacted, providing a superior walking surface, with an offshoot
to the east, towards the center of Rocket Town.

A strange man looks up suddenly as he is addressed, apparently focused on something else.
A strange man says 'Oh whoa hi hey!  Are you a native?'
A strange man winces, realizing how strange that probably sounded.
A strange man says 'Oh, whoops.  Of course you are.  Hi there, at any rate!  I'm, uh...'
A strange man says 'Well, the name's not important, really.  I'm a hunter from, uh, something like a space station orbiting your planet.  Pioneer 2 is what we call it.'
A strange man says 'I'm surveying the land for research and observation data.  It is a very intriguing place you have here!'
A strange man says 'But uh, that's aside, we also welcome visitors too, as long as they aren't the unruly sort.  If you'd like, I can beam you up!'

You think, "I would like to visit Pioneer 2!"

  A bright red glow envelopes this wide chamber, emanating from
trapezoidal beams of light that rise from a broad-standing pad at its
center.  Thick metallic doors stand against the north end of the room, while

metallic sign is grafted onto wall elsewhere, near the ceiling.

Artificial Principality, Pioneer 2 - South Boulevard
  A long stretch of boulevard extends from a southern set of wide metal
doors all the way to the north, the end of which can't be seen from here. 
The station is one of mechanical wonder, with bright lights and neon signs
hoisted where they need to be, and a glowing touchpad is noticeable against
the aforementioned southern doors.  Biological inclusions are visible,
however, such as the normal-looking potted plant sitting on the ground
nearby.  Both nearby and in the distance, people of various genetic makeups
are seen moving about and chatting with each other, making the place seem
almost city-like.

Pioneer 2 - Boulevard
  The street branches off on a very short path toward the west from here,
leading to a large, square-cut open door of a building.  Set atop this
doorway is a brightly-lit neon sign, advertising itself in an odd futuristic
font.  The path ahead looks to gradually become reddish in color as the glow
of a transportational device, set off to one side, bathes a wide area around
it in its own pulsing light.

Pioneer 2 - Rest Area
  A set of steel benches are set off to one side of the road, centered
around a small metallic fountain fashioned from some old-world historic
design, quietly bubbling a clean stream of water.  A raised stone platform
sits on either side of the benches, each centered with a mound of soil and
growing grass therefrom.  Soft red light blooms from the glare of a
teleportation pad just to the east, and a very large building can be seen a
decent ways to the north of here.  

(] Exits: north east south [)
     A set of steel benches are aligned around the area, offering multiple seats.

Pioneer 2 - North Boulevard
  Coming closer into view, a looming building can now be seen as two
"detached" buildings that are separated only by a high-raised catwalk that
appears to go from roof to roof, and a subtle alleyway leads around to the
side.  The structure spanning a large portion of the northwest end bears a
massive neon sign that shimmers from color to color in an endless cycle,
while the northern, somewhat-smaller building has no such sign, and only
seems to have a wide counter stretching across its front.  The road extends
north and south from here.

Pioneer 2 - Congregation Plaza
  Sliding doors here provide an entrance to a somewhat-extravagant
building, brightly-lit in all aspects where the glow of neon and
phosphorescent lighting don't already dominate.  The immediate vicinity
expands out into a cul-de-sac section, with a number of smaller and darker
buildings set into the backdrop, away from the general public.  A smaller,
but still fairly large, building is set into the north end of this
artificial city, and further down the strip, a domed building can be seen.

  The back end of this subsection glows with a pale red light, given off by
the neon sword-shape that is fused into the wall thereupon.  A couple of
weapon parts are stacked upon each other at one end of the counter, looking
to be bladeless hilts and pommels.  Behind this counter, a strange

with less fire and more machine parts.

all around them.  Not far to the east, the ocean roars in the harbor.

l ael
Tall and slim, pale of skin and with hair dark as a raven's wing tied in an waistlength, intricate braid, the young woman might well be called beautifull, were it not for a darkness that seems to shroud her very presence. Her eyes are a deep red, a crimson shade close to black, yet they seem to shimmer from within with a malevolent fire if cast in the slighest shadow.
Clad in a curiously ornate dress of fine black, thick cloth with accents of red and gold. Its layered skirts billow out to allow surprising mobility for such a heavy garment, while stout leather boots can be seen worn beneath them.
A short-cropped, dark leather jacket worn on top fits snugly over her torso, its sleeves ending beneath heavy, armored bracers covered in arcane script. Her sole, visible weapon appears to be a thick, oaken staff, a ruby red gem of considerable size affixed on one end, nestled within a metal embracement.
Aelys is in perfect condition.

<worn on head>      a helmet of solidified mist

l loop
This bizarre device looks like a hand-sized silver hoop, except that its
interior appears to be filled with some sort of purple-y space-and-void type
stuff.  Putting your hand through the center of reveals that said hand does
not come out the other side!  This precious item can be exchanged to Lilly
to allow you to break the rules a single time - you may transfer ONE (1)
item from a different character that you own, and give it to the character
that is exchanging the Loop-Hole.  It's all the fun of being a criminal with
none of the backlash!  
 
Loop-Holes can also come in an (ASTRAL) variety, as well.  This upgraded
version allows you to transfer THREE (3) items from a different character
you own!

Just like the real thing, only smaller!  Two pairs of felt wings drape
over the side of this cute dragon, which is white all over save for a yellow
underbelly and the wingtips, which are tipped with cyan and magenta.  A pair
of plastic fangs poke out of the sides of its mouth, giving it a dopey look
and making it just that much cuter!

l doll
This little doll has some very precise and distinct craftsmanship
associated with it.  Everything from the plush petals, to the button eyes,
to the poseable limbs appear to have been carefully designed, creating one
heck of a childhood toy.  It wears a bright green kimono wrapped about
itself, and the back of it has a clip attached so that one can wear it on
their belt and show it off to the world.  A small tag on the back of one leg
reads "Fukawa Industries, Inc."

Aelys says 'being, any high-lvl weapon. Between the dam-roll cap, and some other mysterious factors, I've seen very little difference between 0 enchant, 10 enchant, and even 20 enchant. It all just makes your average damdice rolls better. The multiplication of DamRoll factor, the key-point for high-enchants, is borked'

Aelys says 'I've Scienced it, there is still a benefit, it's just nowhere near the effect it should be, if the enchants actually still worked. Low lvl, it's fine, but high-lvl, its buried in the numbers of the Average DamDice of the Weapon, to the point a good roll on the DamDice of an Unenchanted, can do the same as a +20 enchanted on an average roll for it'

l art
This strange brew is a condensed and carbonated form of pure artificial
magic, like the kind they make physical magical items out of.  Applying this
to a wand or staff that you own (with an Immortal's help, of course) will
increase the maximum number of charges by 50% (rounded up) as well as
refresh all expended charges.  Alternately, you can use it on a rod-type
item that you own to decrease the cooldown time by 25%.  Some restrictions
may apply!  
 
This item also comes in a (CARBONATED) variety, the version of which will
increase maximum charges by 100% and decrease rod-item cooldown times by
50%!

Truce - 9th National Bank
  Faux marble pillars decorate the corners of the bank, whitewashed along
with the rest of the interior.  The teller is situated behind a counter made
of more faux marble, and the shatterproof glass is framed by a miniature
arch.  The Roman motif is completed by a fresco of a god situated directly
over the vault door.  

(] Exits: east [)
     Several boxy steel lockers have been installed along the wall.
     A box rests on the counter, potentially full of missing things.
(Charmed) A huge rafflesia plant walks around here.
(Charmed) A grey-furred rabbit warrior stands watch fearlessly.
Aelys deMalfue is here.
[AFK] Deku Scrub Pascal, leafy thiefy is here, with a fairy flitting around them.
The Truce Banker is here behind a counter.
